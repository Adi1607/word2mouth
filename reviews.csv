Unfortunately, I don't find their food to reflect the upscale vibe or price tag associated with it.
We appreciated their listing of allergens on the menu but still felt a bit disappointed that only one curry / larger entree could be made vegan.
We ordered:
-- Vegan Chutney Sampler ($5.5) // The variety of five chutneys was good, but I didn't find them alone to be worth the price.
-- Vegan Channa Bhatura Curry ($22) // The highlight of the meal, this curry was nuanced, fresh and delicious. It was small for $22, though.
-- Vegan Mixed Chile
Uttapam
($14) // SUPER spicy, and my girlfriend and I can almost always handle the kick. The menu did say ""spicy!"" but I think this warranted a bit more warning than that. Regardless, this was tasty, but I didn't think it was worth $14... and I know, I'm getting repetitive. The soup that accompanied the
uttapam
was, however, super delicious.
Overall, my girlfriend and I enjoyed our meal but the warm ambiance and friendliness of our server couldn't make up for the seemingly unwarranted cost of our dinner. I don't think I'll find myself returning, since we left a bit unsatisfied and ultimately, still hungry."

But some Indian friends recommended this place and I'm always up for trying something new. We had kinda a large group so we were able to make a reservation ahead of time. Though we sat around for about 15 minutes after we arrived, while they were ""setting up our table."" We got a bunch of appetizers - samosas, idli fries, and the chutney sampler. The idli fries are bomb. They were like right out of the fryer hot. Not sure exactly what they were but they tasted like fries. And it comes with a unique dipping sauce. The chutney sampler came with 4 chutneys and we enjoyed them with a truly addictive (and complementary) papad (kinda like Indian chips). I could've just had a whole meal on this, as the chips were salty and flavorful and you can't have just one. Samosas were ok - nothing out of the ordinary.  Then the rest of us got some kind of dosa. I actually tried the
uttapam
sampler.
Uttapam
is like a thicker dosa. I couldn't tell you all the different types of the
uttapam
but I enjoyed all five of them. All were vegetarian though and some had cheese that I remember. I also tried some my bf's paper masala dosa. The dosa itself is huge and crepe-like and I like the spicy chutney and the dipping sauce. I think I also got to try the bhatura, which is like the puffed crepe or flat bread. I think I liked it more than the paper dos, bc it had a bit more of a sweet flavor. Everything I had was really good and thanks to our friends for showing this type of cuisine. I will definitely need to search out more southern Indian cuisines."

Had heard so much about this place, so finally decided to give it a try. This place has great ambience, but sadly, the food did not live up to the hype.
Being a south Indian myself, I was really excited about this place. We ordered the pani puri shots for appetizers, and we got 4 puris with pani served in shot glasses. The puri tasted fresh and crispy, however we felt it was over priced for just 4 puri's ($10). It's also quite rare that you find only 4 puri's per serving of pani puri.
For the main course, I ordered a chicken thalli and my husband ordered the rava dosa. The rava dosa was good. It was with good serving of sambar, which I was happy with, although nothing extraordinary. The chicken thalli came with small servings of salads(2), chk fry, chk curry, channa, sambar, rasam, raita, curd,
uttapam
, lemon rice and white rice. All of which were average. Nothing bad, but wouldn't really go back.
We live in San Jose and there are numerous options for great south Indian food for 1/4th the price. So if you're one of them, don't waste your time."

The goat belly (honey and pepper roasted) was definitely the best part of the meal.  It was a real treat and we got the last order that night.  Other items were also quite good - I would re-order that chicken curry and lamb DOSA any day.
The ambiance inside the restaurant is nice. I particularly liked the high ceilings and the abundance of natural light.  Service was really good and the food came out really fast.

We order the Paneer & Peas Dosa, Roasted Chile & Garlic Dosa, Brokaw Avocado Chaat, Philipkutty Chicken Curry, and the South Indian Moons (5 different
uttapams

Landing at the place with a prior reservation, we were welcomed by a big heavy door and a sizeable eating joint designed at two levels.  Little did I realise that it was the only big thing that we were gonna be experiencing in the restaurant that night (besides the final cheque of course which was already expected)
We immediately realised after talking to the hostess that they had forgotten to reserve a table for us (Yelp??). They tried to turn it around with a tiny corner table on the upper level which could have seated 5 kids maybe! After a few minutes of contemplation, maybe the staff realised we were definitely not gonna sit in each other's laps and the guests on the adjacent table sportingly moved to make more space for us.
The real horror started then with our server for the day, Brittany C. Now when a restaurant decides to charge you a 20% service markup automatically just because you are group of 5 or more, the least that you expect is a decent service! But Brittany came in with a tiny heart and grumpy attitude and seemed more in a mood as if we were there to eat for free!
After a very offending introduction to a ""$60 set menu or the preferable ala carte menu"", we placed our orders without any recommendations being offered by her despite telling that it was our first visit. We ordered the rava dosa, egg dosa, chile
uttapam
and goat biryani along with a rasam
The complimentary pappadums never came out even though the meal came pretty quickly. We had to explicitly ask for them before they turned up. Now the dosa and
uttapam
were served with a moderate sized bowl of Sambhar and tiny portions of chutneys. Anyway knowing anything about south indian food may please enlighten me how to eat a dosa with a few spoons of Sambhar and a teas0oonful of chutney??
The food was served very rudely and when we asked if we could get more chutney, we got a condescending answer of ""it will cost you $2"". When we have our consent another server brought it out and it was shockingly just another teaspoonful! We asked the new server if this is what we get in $2, he got confused and said he will be right back after checking but it never happened!
Now in this entire episode the food isn't anything great to write about. It isn't bad but it is definitely not worth a 4* for someone who knows how south indian tastes like. The goat biryani is definitely not a recommendation at all!!
Coming back to the service, we never got any water refills and noone checked on how we were liking the food. At the end of it we left most of the goat biryani but Brittany just brought out the cheque and didn't even care to ask why the biryani was left over. For the biryani we asked for a take away box (thought we could give it to someone needy) but Brittany just brought the box and placed it rudely in front of us without a word or smile
After all this, we decided that the service did not deserve a 20% charge and we called in the manager who came in with a fake smile and concern. The manager heard our entire ordeal and said she will fix the bill and offered free desserts. We told her very clearly we didn't want free stuff but also didn't want to pay for a service we didn't get and just wanted the charge removed. But she insisted that as it was mother's day she would want us to have desserts so we agreed. And then she crumpled the old bill right in front of us, don't know if that was really required to be done!
In comes Brittany with the dessert (oh the horror!!). She placed one dessert in front of us rudely (she could have dropped it on our head if she could have had her way) and made a statement ""you talked to my manager, your bill will come in soon"" and just walked away. And then she comes back with another one and leaves with a statement ""hope the free desserts make up for your concerns"". Hello?? Why the hell do people think that customers complain to get free stuff?? Oh and she did come in again to offer chai or coffee which she said was on her. Well dear Brittany, after the experience I would not even had Water if ""it was on you""
Coming from India, I always thought America offers a different standard of service to customers. But dear DOSA management, believe me I realise now that tiny hearts and money minded businesses are incapable of offering anything more than a product. Please keep your free stuff to yourself, if you can offer anything do offer some warmth in your cold little place!
To Mr Anjan - Thanks for your revert but it just reaffirms your attitude towards the whole incident! We are not looking for your free stuff so please keep the offer to yourself. Would have been happier to see your revert say we would offer impeccable and warm service!"

It is more like an Indian fusion restaurant than an authentic Southern Indian place. If we ever crave for dosa again, we probably will go somewhere else.
On the day of our visit, the majority of the dishes offered on the menu were vegetarian. Though the restaurant wasn't full, we waited for A LONG TIME before the staff came to take our order.
For the dosa, we ordered the classic Masala dosa (4/5). There were three complementary sauces and they were all pretty decent. They were more on the sour side. The dosa came really fast and the crepe itself was thin and crisp. Pretty good.
We also ordered mixed mushroom
Uttapam
. This dish was really meh. It felt like a simple pizza on an Indian dough.
Uttapam
was kinda sour and there was quite a lot of cheese on the dish. The complementary sauces were the same as the dosa's. The dish was fairly bland and also soggy. We could not manage to finish this.
Our last dish was the goat dum biryani. This was probably our favorite dish out of the three we ordered. The goat biryani was sitting inside a naan-bread like bowl and there was a yogurt-like complementary sauce. The biryani was well flavored and decently spicy. We really loved the goat -- super juicy, soft and well-seasoned.
It's a decent Indian restaurant but with how much it is charging u, I probably won't revisit again."

The potato was quite creamy, and the dosa was light and crispy. I liked the sauces to dip the dosa in- it wasn't super spicy for me, but it can be, especially if you're not used to the heat. The sambar (lentil and vegetable dipping soup) was good as well.
I tried a bite of my friend's

We snuck into the restaurant right before closing. Still, our waiter was very courteous even though we stayed past official hours. The decor of the restaurant is classy and is definitely a hip, upscale place.
For food, I opted to try the South Indian Moons-- the chef's selection of five different

I asked the waitress why everything was so different, and she said they recently had some menu changes. I could not be more depressed about this. I ordered the Idli fries as an appetizer, which were unimpressive and the
prawn
masala
as my entree. The curry to the
prawn
masala
tasted like watery tomato soup with some spices, and was not even the consistency of normal curry. My mom ordered a chicken curry, which also had a watery consistency, and no flavor. This is one of the pricier Indian restaurants, and I had always felt it was worth it perviously, but if you're thinking of going there now, I'd advise you to save your money."

We made a reservation on Yelp and waited at the bar while they got our table ready. They have a really great cocktail selection and looks like they regularly rotate out new drinks. I forget what I had but it was spicy and unique.
My first thought was what's a DOSA? They're basically giant Indian tacos but a little more sophisticated. First off, they're huge. They're veggies and meat wrapped in delicious bread. We got one or two as an app and it was great. We got some other apps as well but the must have one is the giant puffy bread. It's literally fried dough the size of a basketball and filled with air. It tasted great and was fun to eat.
For the main dish I got the
Prawn
Masala
. I love all things coconut milk and seafood. It was exactly what I wanted. You don't get a ton of food here like most Indian place. For $30 it was perfect for one person but I didn't have any leftovers.

I have never made a reservation at DOSA, but am thinking we should start. Every time we've gone, we've gone at prime dinner time (7pm-8pm) and have seen a long wait. Every time, we've miraculously found a spot at the bar or been seated at a table in record time. Lucky, I guess! I am not a huge fan of eating at the bar here, as it is busy and noisy. I'm paying the same for the meal, I would prefer the ""full"" experience. Sitting at a table is lovely and service at both table and bar is top notch.
Now for the food: boyfriend always gets a dosa and loves them! I've been a fan of dosas, but for whatever reason I don't dig DOSA's dosas. So I've experimented... One time, I got a mango salad with some sea tuber that was inedible it was so salty. Another time, I got scallops (eh). Once, I just ordered bread. Last time, I got the
prawn
masala
which was great. I finally found my dish. One thing never changes: I always order the bhatura. Oh. My. Sweet. Jesus. I love this bread so much. When it comes out, it's a huge puff the size of your head. Everyone stares. Worth it. It's like low key fried dough. I could eat that bread every day (and do every time we go to DOSA). Huge highlight even when my main dish isn't to die for.
Overall, love this place. Great upscale ambiance, great place to bring visitors. Again, would recommend a reservation. Also, without fail, we are always surprised by the bill. Both food and drink are a little spendy for weeknight Indian, but we keep coming back!"

When you walk in, you notice how beautiful the space is. The whole ambiance of the place is indeed trendy, as yelp would put it... not an authentically Indian vibe, but still very appealing. A little too dimly lit for me, perhaps also an oddly desirable music playlist - indie electronic hits? Either way, seemed like a great place to be for dinner and drinks at the end of well-deserved week.
My party of 4 decided to go for the prix fix menu (featured as part of their Restaurant Week menu, but also something that they offer on the regular). Each plate was phenomenal and mindfully prepared. Some standouts for me were: the Sprouted Mung and Paneer Salad, Goan
Prawn

, and the Classic
Masala
Dosa (the chef was also nice enough to give us an additional Sweet Potato Dosa to accommodate the 4 of us). The curries were spicy even for me, but I love me a good spicy dish - so no complaints from me although that could be an area of concern for many others.

Given SF's trends of overpriced food, I was a skeptic but got lured by Restaurant Week, when I found Dosa to be the only place with a worthwhile menu. While most other restaurants feature the anti-climatic addition of a salad and a brownie for a 3-course meal, Dosa became an adventurous feast through spices and creative cooking.
[SMALL PLATES]
(++) Chips - You start off with complimentary chips, and it's unlike anything I've ever eaten before. It's light, crispy, and has a handful of seeds thrown in.
(++) Chennai chicken - The expertly roasted chicken maintains a savory juiciness while imparting strong smokey tones, contrasting boldly with the cool cucumber and yogurt sauce.
(++) Sprouted mung & paneer salad - The varied landscape of flavors was noteworthy, but the texture was truly outstanding. This dish deserves some mindful eating to fully appreciate how the chewy coconut, crunchy pomegranate, and springy arugula simultaneously influence the sprouted mung bean, which ends up tasting more crispy or soft depending on what ends up in that particular forkful. The paneer is interestingly akin to tofu, and I enjoyed the pure taste in contrast to the more pungent versions I usually see.
(++) Beet croquettes - The sophisticated take pulls off a vegetable-based, cream-free, extra creamy croquettes. Not only does the blend of several vegetables create a palatable base; the incorporation of spices, nuts, curry, and a cranberry chutney adds extra layers of complexity.
[CURRIES ETC.]
(+++) Nagai vegetable korma - I chose this somewhat as a chore so we could eat our veggies, knowing that vegetable dishes typically pales next to meat dishes (even at State Bird!) But we (even the boo who is usually carnivorous) were blown away. The perfect spice blends of age-old South Indian cuisine combined with novelty vegetables like marble potatoes and romanesco creates a dish that looks modest but synergistically showcases the magic of fresh produce and ethnic cooking. How Californian :)
(+) Goan
prawn
masala
- I was unimpressed by the portion size of one shrimp per person, and that these were standard-sized shrimp and not
prawns
. The marsala is constructed from distinctly fresh ingredients, but was dominated by the fiery spiciness.
(+++) Roasted
masala
lamb shank - In an era when fine dining consists of abstractly small portions, this ginormous leg of a lamb was a surprise and well worth the extra charge. The 5-hour slow braising resulted in fall-off-the-bone tender and had a similar pervasively roasty flavors to the chennai chicken (excellent savory dish in itself, but exacerbates the spiciness of the
prawn
masala
). The mix of spices with the vegetable-based seasoning added subtlety, and the lamb paired well with the fragrant lemon herb rice.
[DESSERT]
(+/-) Sweet cheese patties - Not sure if my expectations had just built up too high over the meal or if the dessert is too advanced for me, but despite the intrigue of rose water I think this was my least favorite. The cheese itself had a limp texture and tasted in between savory cheese and dessert, and the conglomerate of cream/nut/cardamom/floral added to the confusion for me.
(+) Pistachio barfi - As a whole it tasted like an artisan dark chocolate; however it was too sugary, which overshadowed any fascinations from cashew milk and hibiscus.
[DRANKS]
(++) Mango lassi ($5) - Good mango flavor, easy to drink and not too thick.
With the tagline ""Urban South Indian dining with a Californian sensibility"", Dosa exemplifies the unique (and delicious) global-local theme that takes the fusion concept to the next level.
Presentation is on-point Instagram-worthy for the most part--from the giant fluffy channa bhatura bread that always catches your eye as it passes by your table, to the fine dining-esque display of beet croquettes on a wooden board with a magenta smear. I actually like how there's also a mix of more plain presentation, such as the vegetable korma in the traditional Indian bowl, which tones down any pretentiousness.
Ambiance is swanky, with extremely dim lighting (if good food pictures are a priority, I strongly recommend coming for a sunny brunch instead). The tall ceilings with a half second level and bar along one side reminds me of NoPa.
Although service was friendly, I must say my main gripe overall was the slowness (We arrived at 5:45 and left at 8:45 o.O) (Which meant extra $$ needed for parking; they only validate $2) Ironically, the server checked in with us several times to ask if our round of apps/entrees had arrived, and our answer was that none or only one had come. She also took forever on the mango lassi when boo was breathing fire from the spiciness.
Pro tip: Although the menu is extensively notated with dairy/egg/gluten/nut free/vegan, it lacks spiciness warnings. If you can't handle spicy, I suggest avoiding anything that says ""curry leaves"" and/or prophylactically getting yourself a glass of mango lassi."

The number of 5 stars reviews that I write have gone down sharply since I have started writing more reviews. I try to reserve them for something special and unique. This place deserves 5 stars for its combination of wonderful food and amazing ambience. I can nearly say that this place has the best ambience amongst the Indian restaurants that I have been to in the US, till now.
For people of Indian origin, I would recommend this place for taking non-Indian friends out to and especially if you have to take your parents or relatives out for a meal. This will definitely be a place that will leave a good impression. For everyone, this is the kind of ambience and food that I want every Indian place should have. Gets busy over the weekend so make a reservation.
Now that I have commented enough about other things let's get to the food.
Appetizers: order the Fried Idllis, and chennai chicken. Both are nice and good.
Main course: being named Dosa, we had to try some dosa's and they turned out to be pretty good. Over two visits we have tried Mung dosa, Rava dosa, and Paneer Dosa. I liked the Mung and Rava dosa more than the Paneer dosa. We tried some other entrees also: really loved the
Prawn
masala
and the Channa Bhatura. If you don't want to have a dosa I would recommend either of these two. Both had wonderful flavor.
Sweets: Ras malai was good.
Mango lassi was also good.

Onto the food - be forewarned that if you have a palate that is SLIGHTLY sensitive to spice, most of the items we ordered had a low heat that built up over the course of the meal. I personally love spicy, but I had 2 friends who wished they'd been warned about the spice on the menu beforehand.
The menu was a bit overwhelming so we followed the recommendations of our waiter.

-- Chennai Chicken: I would describe this dish as flavorful chicken tenders served with a yogurt sauce and onions. Very shareable, good for a small group to split!

Dosa: Of course you have to order a dosa when you come to DOSA! This was my first time trying one, and I loved the concept of various dipping sauces.

Unfortunately our time at this restaurant was a major disappointment from start to finish, and will linger in our minds as one of the worst dining experiences we have ever had.  Prior to coming in we had made and confirmed  a reservation through the dining room manager, Dan, for fourteen people at seven thirty in the evening, yet when we arrived at the restaurant we were told that a reservation was made for only eight people by the host ( a man wearing a black hat and a goatee) who had a very combative attitude and demeanor towards my uncle. We were told to wait and after some time we finally got a table for all of our party ; this negative incident set the tone for the rest of the evening which only got progressively worse as it went on. We started off with the Chennai Chicken for appetizers which had an extremely odd texture and a batter that was not particularly noteworthy and quite bland. The Chicken Biryani was flavorless, and did not taste at all like what a proper biryani should taste like. The
prawn
masala
was passable however it was still very mediocre ; perhaps the most disappointing dish of all however, were the lamb chops which not only fell short of the proper marination  but it also had a very off putting taste of raw and uncooked spices that made the dish highly unenjoyable for our palettes. The food that we ate at this restaurant was so unexceptional,forgettable and flavorless  that we would never even think of considering to come back to this place. The chef ( if there is one) needs proper training to bring out the delectable flavors that are commonly found in great Indian cuisine.Pseudo concoctions of spices, are not acceptable in an establishment where the prices are so lavishly expensive. We have no problem paying any amount provided that the food is in par with the prices being charged. While  our waiter ( Forest) was attentive and did his job well, what we found to be even worse than the food at this restaurant was how we were treated towards the end of our meal. We completed eating our meal, but my father was still finishing his drink of Gin and Tonic when we were abruptly and quite rudely told to leave by the host who was a gentleman wearing a black  hat and had a goatee, because apparently according to him there were   too many people waiting to be seated and we were occupying space . We were absolutely flabbergasted by the way that we were treated ; no one should be disrupted from their dining experience and be told to leave and especially not when it was obvious that we were clearly not done and ready to go. Considering the exorbitant  amount of money  we payed to eat here ($646.73), the host service and food that we received was not acceptable on any level. While the ambiance at this restaurant was beautiful, the subpar food combined with the disrespectful way that we were treated has left us with a very bad taste in our mouth and we will not be returning in the future. This is very typical of an absentee owner ( Anjan Mitra) who is ambitious to expand his empire without any desire or passion to maintain and perfect the establishments that he already has. I highly recommend that the owner should retrain his staff and read the book Setting the Table by Danny Meyers, which is a must read for all of the staff in order to fully grasp and understand the basic and critical nuances of the hospitality industry."

Though we sat around for about 15 minutes after we arrived, while they were ""setting up our table."" We got a bunch of appetizers - samosas, idli fries, and the chutney sampler. The idli fries are bomb. They were like right out of the fryer hot. Not sure exactly what they were but they tasted like fries. And it comes with a unique dipping sauce. The chutney sampler came with 4 chutneys and we enjoyed them with a truly addictive (and complementary) papad (kinda like Indian chips). I could've just had a whole meal on this, as the chips were salty and flavorful and you can't have just one. Samosas were ok - nothing out of the ordinary.  Then the rest of us got some kind of
dosa
. I actually tried the uttapam sampler. Uttapam is like a thicker
dosa
. I couldn't tell you all the different types of the uttapam but I enjoyed all five of them. All were vegetarian though and some had cheese that I remember. I also tried some my bf's

dosa
as you can imagine is a house specialty and well worth it. Big enough for sharing, I recommend getting one dish per person and then sharing family style. Today we tried the summer thali (a sampler of about 10 different dishes), the
paper
masala
dosa
(basically potatoes and
dosa
), and South Indian moons which were little gluten-free pancakes each highlighting a different ingredient. So much fun.
Food: GREAT!The taste was spicy without being overwhelming or too hot. The
masala
(potatoes) were among the best I've tried (and I've tried a lot). And even though I didn't don't love everything on the sampler platter I loved the chance to explore new flavors.
Allergy-friendly: Very allergy-friendly. The menu clearly marks which items are gluten, egg, dairy, and nut free. And it's GOOD
Service: seriously attentive people. Came around often without being bothersome. Filled up our water routinely without having to ask. And asked how things were going.
If you're looking for good Indian food in the Bay (near Japantown) come to

on Fillmore, San Francisco: 7 April 2018 (by maggiesfoodjournal)
From start to finish, the experience here was a day to remember. Our server, PJ was friendly and cheerful. She did not rush us to order - and at the same time was very helpful. After we had sat down, PJ brought a serving of Papadum. These thin, crisp, chips with popping flavours were a hit at our table.
Our orders:
Paper
Masala
Dosa
:
Dosa
is a kind of pancake - its main ingredients are rice and urad beans.
Dosa
is a South Indian dish - popular all over the Indian subcontinent. This large, thin, pliable, crispy, thin cracker came with potato and other dips. (5 of 5)
Rava
Masala
: Potato
masala
with onions and cashew. It had the perfect spice and heat - an excellent marriage with the crispy semolina wheat
dosa
. (5 of 5)
Lamb 'Keema': Three of us ordered this item. The plain
dosa
was a genius way to accompany the spiced minced lamb. (5 of 5)
Mango Lassi: All of us had the mango lassi. I am not a big fan of yogurt but I like mangoes - so this gives me a chance to combine the two together. It's not too sweet and well balanced. (5 of 5)
Madras Coffee: The coffee seeds are shade-grown and brewed with chicory. Gladly, I did not taste the chicory - but I could use more sugar in my drink. (4.5 of 5)

Both were v.good, the fries nice and crunchy and loaded with a tasty spice rub, the vada pav a delicious mixture of sweet and sour (pro-tip from a Mumbaikar- where the vada pav was invented: make the vada less soggy by holding back on the imli chutney! Also would've been nice if it was a tad spicy). All in all, the appetizers were a success. For mains we got the

Made a reservation to go here for

tonight for July 4th and the service was horrible!
The restaurant was busy which is understood but there was clear chaos in the service.
It took the waiter a good 10 minutes to come by the table to take the order.
After we finally ordered here is sequence of events:
Drinks: ordered a glass of wine, a beer, kingfisher and a kids mango lassi. The first drinks to arrive was mango lassi; came in a kids cup but no straw and the wine. Asked the server about the missing beer and he said he will check and he walked away casually without acknowledging the missing straw on the cup?! Hello!! How do you expect the kid to drink that??
Will come back to the beer in a bit...
Asked another server passing by for a straw and he delivered one..
Ordered Vada pav for appetizer & prawn
masala
, paratha and
paper
masala
dosa
for entree.
The first food item to be delivered was the prawn
masala
(which comes with rice) minus the paratha. No sign of appetizer either or the beer.
Story of the beer: After 10 more minutes of waiting the waiter stopped by and my husband asked for the beer and his response?! We ran out of kingfisher yesterday. I am sorry I just found out, can I get you a pilsner instead? My husband, ahhh ok, please do! And the beer came after another 10 minutes of ordering that!!! Phew!
And then came the paratha!  And another 5 mins after that came the appetizer, vada pav.

-Paneer & Peas

-Idli Sambhar: Super
-Chennai Chicken: Another yummer
-Lamb Chops: Little sweet for my indian taste buds
-Vada Pav: Mini sliders..Perfect and so tasty!
This was definitely a 5 starred restaurant for us, but in my last two visits to
Dosa
, I was a little unhappy with my Dahi rice and Sambhar, and hence the 4 stars. Another thing that I usually get very annoyed with is their constant menu changes, another downer for me.
Not a big fan of their desserts except one, so if you love mangoes, make sure you leave some room for their mango pudding, tried & tested many times!! :)

I came with two girl friends on a Monday night around 7 and were seated immediately by the window. We stuffed ourselves and I am now a fan of
Dosa
and am so so glad that the 7x7 list brought me here!
Good things (so pretty much everything we ordered)
Appetizer:
- Vada pav (veggie slider): Okay so the name really doesn't do it justice, mostly because I love meat and think all sliders should be made with beef patties, but this was SO flavorful and delicious. The bun is sweet and the caramelized onions provide a nice contrast to the dry but perfectly seasoned potatoes. The dish comes with gunpowder, which is this spicy chili powder that you mix with melted butter to form a chili spread. It's really fun to make haha. BTW this is also super spicy.
Main courses:
- Channa bhatura: Probably my favorite indian dish ever. This gigantic fried, puffy dough comes out and hot steam actually comes out when you tear into it. It's such a wonderful sight! Then you dip the bread into this wonderfully flavorful chickpea dish and you can expect what my roommate calls a ""food baby"" for the rest of the evening. So worth it. I've had this dish at Vik's Chaat in Berkeley, but the puffy thing is overly greasy there. It's actually quite light and flavorful here.
-
Paper
masala
dosa
: This is what I came to try, the infamous
paper
masala
dosa
. It's actually humungous so, if you can visualize, three girls at the smallest table possible with the giant bhatura and now this long
dosa
too. I think we were in a little over our heads when we ordered :) So our waiter advised us on how to eat this, by tearing off a piece of the crispy
dosa
and dipping it into the potato mixture and then dipping it into one of three sauces: sambar, a tomato sauce and a coconut sauce. We ended up mixing and matching everything on our table, which was an extremely pleasant experience for our tastebuds haha. The only complaint about this dish is that the
dosa
itself is a little salty, so dipping it is kind of necessary to offset the saltiness.
Dessert:
- Rasmalai: I don't know how we managed to do this because we basically had carbs for our entire meal, but we ended up picking this. It's a surprisingly light dessert even though it's creamy and has the texture of panna cotta but is made of CHEESE! The rosewater fragrance is really nice and the pistachios add a great texture. Perfect way to end such a heavy meal.
The total came out to be $60 after tax and tip. The best part was probably our waiter who explained how to eat everything haha. Definitely coming back to try all the other different
dosas
...and to have something with meat."

Now this is yelp, the thank you economy, and pure customer service done right. The owner reached out to me regarding my A-OK review and welcomed me to come back and try a few appetizers on him. I literally live 4 blocks away so my roommates and I stopped by here on Tuesday night for
dinner
.
Their
dinner
offerings were excellent. All the items provide very generous servings and they definitely kicked up the spice a notch with these dishes. We got the following:
Chaat -- Mangos in chaat? Who would have thought. Apparently this is a South Indian norm to put fruit in chaat and I don't know why us Northerners haven't picked up on how good that is.
Dahi Vada -- Amazing presentation and great taste. They really know how to take Indian street food and make it classy
Pakora -- To be fair, I'm not a fan of these generally so I have a bit of a bias against this dish. Clever take on the chutneys mimicking ketchup and mustard.
Paper
Masala
Dosa
-- Solid traditional
dosa
dish. Ask for extra of the orange chutney. Nom.
Basil
Dosa
-- 3/4 of us are Indian and have grown up with all this goodness. This
dosa
made all of us take a step back and admire how they made this. It's like pesto meets
masala
. Very good.
Channa Batura -- Seriously, the batura was bigger than my head. INSANE. The channa was excellent. The batura was definitely a little oily for my liking but that tends to happen when its deep fried.
Needless to say, I definitely had my mind changed and cannot wait to make this a neighborhood regular. Cheers to your restaurant, Anjan."

idli

idli
fries are bomb. They were like right out of the fryer hot. Not sure exactly what they were but they tasted like fries. And it comes with a unique dipping sauce. The chutney sampler came with 4 chutneys and we enjoyed them with a truly addictive (and complementary) papad (kinda like Indian chips). I could've just had a whole meal on this, as the chips were salty and flavorful and you can't have just one. Samosas were ok - nothing out of the ordinary.  Then the rest of us got some kind of dosa. I actually tried the uttapam sampler. Uttapam is like a thicker dosa. I couldn't tell you all the different types of the uttapam but I enjoyed all five of them. All were vegetarian though and some had cheese that I remember. I also tried some my bf's paper masala dosa. The dosa itself is huge and crepe-like and I like the spicy chutney and the dipping sauce.

For the table, my family and I ordered a the Kerala chicken, vada pav,
idli
fries, dosas (Paneer masala, rava, paper) - the rava dosa was my favorite on the menu. The paneer masala was not very appetizing. The Kerala chicken was spicy and extremely fried! Really great for a cheat meal.
At the end of our meal, I ordered their herbal tea and it was enough for share for three to four people! It was great after the big meal for my family and I. Overall, i really enjoyed this place but wish the Dosa was more adorable. $16 for a dosa is white pricey but the appetizers were worth the lunch!"

When you're hungry and just want something flavorful and filling, dosas are usually a go-to. So, when we walked in to Dosa on Fillmore, we had very high expectations.
Walking in through the large heavy door, you're instantly greeted by the heavenly aromas of South Indian cuisine in an open room, lit by elegant chandeliers. We came in at around 8:15pm on a Saturday evening without a reservation and opted to sit at the communal table to avoid the wait. Luckily, we got a spot at the end, so it wasn't too cramped for the four of us. Our server was friendly and attentive, despite being quite busy, and patiently answered all of our questions.
My family and I ordered the
Idli
Sambar, Chile Garlic Dosa, Rava Masala Dosa, Masala Dosa, and Spicy Mung Masala Dosa. The complimentary papadum was thin and crispy, although a couple of the pieces were slightly stale. The
idli
sambar was fantastic - the
idlis
were perfectly soft and not too grainy as some restaurants tend to make them, and the sambar was so flavorful, with just the right amount of spice. All of our dosas were pretty great - good texture, just the right amount of soft and crispy, and strong spices spread across the Chile Garlic and the Spicy Mung dosas. The only thing lacking was a little more flavor in the potato filling in each dosa - it could have used a tad more salt and masala. Otherwise, the dosas were filling and made for a great meal.
We left around 9, and the place seemed to still be bustling. I wish we'd tried the desserts - they sounded decadent - but we were already so full from the dosas. Next time I would probably try more of the shared plates for greater variety. The prices are on the higher end, but food, service, and ambience all make it worth it."

This place is super popular, and entering through the nondescript door (which is automatic, by the way--you only need to give it a tug) brings you into this cavernous world of chandeliers and smelling of spices. I will say it's a bit of a tight squeeze if you're sitting in the booths against the side walls - you'll probably get more intimate with the tables next to you than you will with your partner.
We ordered the mango lassi,
idli
fries, chutney sampler, and masala dosa. The complimentary pappad was so thin and delicious, especially dipped in the chutney sampler. The sauces do pack a decent amount of heat, and the
idli
fries are super crispy and gluten free (!!). However, we did discover that the two sauces we were given with the fries were the same as the ones in the chutney sampler... Poor planning on our part and lack of creativity on theirs.
I was probably least impressed with the dosa. The sauces it came with weren't flavorful enough, and there was only a small patch of potatoes in the very center. You can't skimp on potatoes like that and think it's okay, especially if you're charging $15 for what is essentially an oversize crepe.
I think you can get better dosas elsewhere for lower prices, and the only justification DOSA gets for charging what it does is the ambiance."

First off we weren't even provided a drink menu. We ordered an assortment of shared plates including
Idli

We spoke with the waitress letting her know that my wife was allergic to chickpeas, she confirmed with the chefs and informed us that she could have everything except the vada pav. Turns out the avocado bhel had chickpeas, which we informed our waitress about and later spoke with the manager about. Manager then confirmed that the rest of our dosas and uttapam order will have no chickpeas. Ridiculously, everything contained it. The Sambhar has chickpeas, the dosa potato filling had chickpeas. The manager confirmed with the chefs and they blatantly lied and denied that there was chickpeas. The manager had to show the actual split chickpeas in the filling before they accepted it. Plain ridiculous and unacceptable.
Our waitress was also very slow and did not check up on us. We accidentally spilled water and despite staring right at us did nothing to help. Which for a high end establishment is just plain wrong.
Apart from those major issues, the overall food was pretty average. Shared plates were good, but The dosas were standard Indian fare, couldn't taste any pear flavor in the pear masala dosa, the uttapams were not fully cooked, and the sauces/chutneys were subpar.
If you are looking for modern Indian cuisine there are many better options in the city. DOSA was very disappointing and I would not recommend it."

I actually ended up eating here twice during my recent trip. The food is still as good. I did end up trying a few new things. But the service has gone down for sure, hence, taking a point off. The service is slow, the servers not as attentive. One of the servers came to our table after we had been waiting for 20 minutes. As soon as she arrived, she said ""Are you ready to order""? No greeting, no nothing. Kind of a turn off at a fancy restaurant as this one.
Now to the food:
-
Idli
Fries: unique idea for sure as I have never had
Idli
fries before. Its definitely on the spicy side, as they pour red chilli powder on it. So make sure you can handle spice before you order this.
- Vada Paav: still as good as how I remember from 2012. Absolutely love it.
- Rava Masala Dosa: Delicious....I always prefer the rava dosa crust over the other dosas.
- Chana Bhatura: The channa (chickpeas) is a blend of fava beans and chickpeas, which is a bit of an interesting blend. I would personally prefer just the regular chana (Indian style).
- Ras Malai: Delicious dessert.
- Madras Coffee: Usually the madras coffee I have had is served in a steel glass, but this one comes in a regular cup. Its really good and worth trying.
After 5 years, I am still a fan.  I may not visit the Golden Gate Bridge, but I will surely visit this place every time I go to San Francisco :)"

Idli

The curry to the prawn masala tasted like watery tomato soup with some spices, and was not even the consistency of normal curry.

I decided to take a while to sit and journal at one of the tables inside: here's some of my bad-grammar ramblings about the pastry:
""I take bites of my
morning
bun
slowly because I want to savor every bite - & because it was freaking expensive HAH. But its worth it - a delightful crispy flakiness on the outside - it snaps into pieces as you bite, but it's held together by the caramelized sugar that covers it, slightly sticky on your teeth, tinted with orange like the grownup version of those orange slice gummies from your childhood.

Overall rating: A+++
I'm from NYC so I know good bakeries. During my one week vacation in San Francisco, this was the only place I *HAD* to come back to a second time. I loved it that much! Yes, there was always a wait when I went around 4:15-4:30pm. But it was totally worth it! Dessert is my favorite meal so this was heaven for me. I love they treat their co-op employees well and they get to sleep at night. On the flip side that means you need to wait until staggered times throughout the day to get certain things, such as:
-First thing in the
morning
to get their
morning
buns
+ breakfast goodies
-After 11:30am for made to order hot sandwiches (15 minute wait)
-After 4:30pm for breads (longer if you want half loaves since they need to cool)
Keep in mind they do run out of things as it gets later! So make sure to time your trip properly to get what you want! If you come before the breads are ready, they will write your name and bread order (they do half loaves!) on their Bread List. They will call your name when your delicious carbs are ready and you pay for the breads upon pick up. Here's what I tried across my 2 visits:
-Latte $4.50: I'm not a huge coffee fan, but I sampled my friend's latte and it was amazing! Not that bitter even without any sweetener. I was so enamored I got a small bag of the coffee beans to take home ($17)!
-Strawberry Mousseline Cake $6.25: Hands down my FAVORITE of everything I tried here! The whipped cream was nice and light. The strawberries were fresh (though oddly whole so a bit awkward to eat/share). The cake layer was moist. What's not to love? Tastes like a better version of strawberry shortcake. The slice is pretty small though. Might be a seasonal cake so enjoy it while you can! A+++
-Chocolate Soufflé Cake slice $6.25 (Valrhona chocolate mousse on a thin layer of chocolate cake topped with chocolate ganache): If you like chocolate, you will love this! 3 layers of decadent chocolate and it wasn't too sweet. A+
-4"" Chocolate Hazelnut Tart $6.75 (sweet pastry shell, guanaja, orange):  I wasn't a huge fan of this myself. I just didn't like the orange flavor in this, but that's a personal preference. B+
-Éclair $5.25 (vanilla cream, Valhrona glaze): Not a fan of eclairs and this didn't change my mind about them, but my mother liked it. B-
-Half Olive Bread $5.25 (ONLY available Wed, Fri, and Sun): HOLY MOLY! I WANT TO EAT THIS EVERYDAY! This was my favorite of the breads. I regret not getting a whole loaf of this, but I already had so much bread from the day before. I needed to wait until my next visit to try this since they're only available 3/7 days a week! Excellent texture, just wish there were more olives. The olives had a slight citrus flavor. Try to eat the bread right away. I've never had such fresh bread in my life! It had literally just came out of the oven! A+++
-Sesame Bread $10.25: Great but not as good as the olive bread. A
-Half Ancient Grain Bread $5.25: Nice and hearty. But not as good as the olive bread. A
I really wanted to try the Porridge Bread but it didn't bake properly that day. FYI all the bread I tried were very crusty and on the harder side. Though the inside was light and soft! There's 5% surcharge on your bill to support employee benefits, which I think is great. The employees are super sweet! They patiently explained all the daily breads and bread ordering procedures to me. I think all their breads are sourdough based. Love that they have self serve water on the side with compostable packaging/utensils here. There's a bathroom between the register and coffee bar. You may even get to see them pulling out fresh breads from their giant oven if you come around 4:30pm on your way to the bathroom! If there's no where to sit at Tartine, walk to the nearby gorgeous Mission Dolores Park to enjoy your treats al fresco! The prices are a little higher here, but it's so worth it. I spent almost $100 here over 2 days... No regrets! I would definitely come here again the next time I'm in San Francisco!"

Whenever I do want to splurge in the city, I make a stop by Tartine.  As one gets closer to the establishment, one can delightfully enjoy the smells of the bakery.  Unfortunately, everytime I drop by there is always a line to order something from their delicious bakery with the
morning
times understandably having the longest lines.
I have ordered a variety of different things here but here are a list of things that I have particularly enjoyed:
Banana creme tart: The tart particularly nails the banana flavor with nicely sliced pieces of banana layered in the filling.  But the nice surprise is the layers of milk chocolate along the pie crust which make for a beautiful match made in tastebud heaven.
Morning
buns
:  They would be a welcome pick me up for any day!  Not knowing what these were, they are basically a flaky croissant like pastry lightly flavored with a orange zest that could easily be laced with crack!
Croque monsieur: Enveloped with golden bread to indicate the buttery goodness that has soaked in each of the slices and then filled with hearty pieces of cheese and ham.  Surprisingly, it never feels awfully heavy where I am in an induced food coma.  These come with pickled carrots that definitely provide a welcome acidity to cut through.
The service is fast and friendly. The space inside the actual establishment is small so if you are planning to have a nice brunch with a bunch of your friends you are better off planning to take these goodies to go and walk off to the park.  Parking is limited and again may be better to walk over.
Overall, Tartine Bakery has a lot of great pastries that are worth picking up and enjoying in the city."

Everything is delicious and worth your wait in line.
I try to try a different item every time I come out because I just can't eat it all at once.  The portion sizes are actually quite large and the items are pretty rich.
This time around I got a chocolate croissant and a lemon bar.  SOOOOO GOOOOOOD!!  I can say that the scones (esp savory) are incredible, as well as the
morning
buns

I also haven't noticed a dip in quality over the years.  I mean the place has been open over 15 years and it's super popular.  A lot of places like that tend to dip quality wise and rely on their name alone.

It was our first time here and we didn't know what to expect. Obviously parking in the city is tough, but we found a meter a few blocks away. We got there around 11am, so I was worried about the wait. The line wrapped around the corner, but it went by quickly. It was longer by the time we left. The employees were kicking ass with the never ending line. They got us in and out quickly and painlessly.
We had to stop ourselves from ordering more than 5
morning
buns
. I had read tons of Yelp reviews raving about those delicious pastries, and I knew that I had to try one...or five. We also picked up a lemon cream tart and a lemon bar because my boyfriend absolutely loves all things lemony. Man, that tart was just heavenly- so smooth, so creamy, so decadent. The lemon bar was the perfect combination of tart and sweet, and the pine nut crust was so buttery and crumbly. With all this sweetness, we also picked up a savory scone for some salty counterbalance. My god, what a clutch decision to get that scone. It was probably the best scone I had ever had in my life. I was initially hesitant about trying it because scones are usually too dry for my liking, but this bad boy was buttery and moist from the cheese and it packed a helluva flavor punch from the bacon. I'm salivating just thinking about it. Everything tasted amazing fresh out of the box, and they surprisingly held up well after a day or two, so we had a wonderful treat for our trip home.
Totally worth the wait, I'm looking forward to trying everything else!"

The Morning Bun alone is reason enough to come back, but the Croque Monsieur with Shiitake Mushroom will make the decision even easier.  Simply put, a croque monsieur is a ham and cheese sandwich - but a lot better.  Their offering came with a choice of ham, turkey, shiitake mushroom, or fromage blanc.  Our order came nicely baked with plenty of mushrooms and melted gruyère cheese.  My younger daughter enjoyed it so much that she wanted a single slice to be her next birthday cake.  We just need to buy some candles!
We also tried the huge Gougère (savory choux pastry with gruyère cheese) and the larger-than-usual Pain au Chocolat (chocolate croissant).  They were also delicious, but not as impressive as the other two items we had.  The
quiche
, scone, croissant, cookie, tart, and cake looked appetizing as well, but we would have gone home broke had we decided to try them all.

I've been here at least 6 times so far and have been coming at least twice a month since I've moved here (It's rare that I go anywhere more than once). It also doesn't help that I live a block away from this delightful, delicious bakery.
The pastries they make here are probably the best I've ever had in the city. I'd say my favorite are the almond croissant and the banana cream tart. I've also tried the regular croissant, chocolate croissant, ham and cheese croissant, morning bun, buttermilk scone, lemon meringue cake, ham and egg
quiche
and the croque monsieur with ham.
So I'll speak about the croissants in general. The croissants they create here are HUGE, you might think that $5 is crazy for a croissant but I've paid $5 for croissants that are half the size. Here, they are super sized and can be a meal in itself! The croissants have a dry, crunchy surface that breaks super easily, but a warm, cozy, fluffy inside that almost melts in your mouth. Their croissants here are so good and you'd be fine choosing any croissant.
The banana cream tart is even more filling, it really satisfies the craving for any sweet tooths out there. It comes with banana, whipped cream, caramel, chocolate flakes and a whole bunch of other goodness. One of the best tarts I've ever had.
All the other things I've tried all of them are pretty solid. Things that were pretty average were the morning bun and their scones, but still pretty decent.
Honestly, you can't go wrong here! When in doubt, any of the things first listed in it's section is pretty solid.
Also prepare to wait here! Unless you come really early. There is often a line that can take anywhere from 10 - 30 minutes before when you line up and when you pay for your order. Also don't come too late because they usually run out of the best things early on."

The line was a bit ridiculous and it moves incredibly slow (it was a Saturday morning, so I think everyone had the same idea we had). I think we got a little carried away in attempting to essentially purchase almost one of every pastry, but it was well worth it.
The
quiche
was delicious, you could tell that the crust was homemade and was cooked to perfection. The pastries were unbelievable, I expected they'd be good but the croissants literally tasted like butter, while maintaining such a beautiful, flaky texture (as someone who's baked croissants before, I have a much greater respect for people who do this well). The coffee was made at a separate counter and also did not disappoint.
The shop is rather small, and some of the tables get in the way of the line, and the line gets in the way of utensil/water area. I imagine it wasn't designed to handle the massive crowds that it attracts.... wish they'd take some of their profits and expand the place a little, because it's just not meant to handle the amount of people who visit their shop everyday. I also love that you can look into the kitchen in the back and watch the pastry chefs, live, make all the delicious food at the counter. Highly recommend for a pastry and a coffee."

It doesn't smell overly and sickly sweet, but instead you get that bready, baked, homey smell that anyone who enjoys bread, pastries, and carbs in general would appreciate.
Lemon cream tart - definitely worth trying! If I'm eating something with the words ""lemon"" and ""tart"" in it, that's exactly what I expect and that's exactly what I got! The crust was a little hard for my liking so it was difficult to cut with a fork, but overall my mouth was experiencing lemon heaven. The cream on the top is very light and complements the tart and thick lemon filling super well!
Chocolate souffle cake - if you're a chocolate lover, then you have to get this. It's super rich, dense, and chocolatey -- what more could you ask for in a chocolate cake? The dark chocolate ganache layer is aaamazing -- the bitterness balances out the sweetness of the whole cake. Not to mention, the gold paper on top makes you feel super fancy! But if you enjoy more of a cake-y texture, then this may not be the cake for you since it represents more of a souffle than a cake. (Tip: this cake goes super well with a cup of coffee!)
Croissant - a MUST get! This was probably the priciest croissant I've ever paid for ($4.25 for one croissant), but it's huge!! Plus the outer flakiness, layered buttery goodness and mouthwatering aroma (words can't even describe, you just have to get it yourself to see exactly what I mean) is definitely worth every penny. I've been here twice and each time I had to get their croissant. When you bite into it, the sound alone is to die for and would make for great ASMR sound effects!

quiches

Delicious pastries and coffee that goes perfectly with them. When you order in the morning, the pastries will come out first. If you order coffee, expect another 10 minutes for it to come out. If you order a sandwich, it will likely come out another 10 minutes after the coffee. So this is a dessert first place if you're asking me! The line is never ending. From 15 minutes prior to opening, to when they close. Their loaves of bread are ready for purchase around 4:30pm. Basically, just get in line so that you'll be at the counter around 4:30. That's my best suggestion. Also. Be prepared that when you get to the counter, they may be sold out of something. For pastries, we went twice this week and we tried: a
frangipane
croissant
, morning bun, buttermilk scone, savory scone, lemon cream tart, chocolate hazelnut tart. For coffee, we tried the Valhrona Mocha and cappuccino. The coffee was delicious, truly a craft coffee, and served at a temperature that is actually drinkable (no worries about burning your tongue on the first sips). My favorite pastries were the
frangipane
croissant
and the savory scone. Try everything if you can!  We also tried the Idiazabal & Membrillo sandwich and 3 different loaves of bread: ancient grain, porridge and walnut.

Lemon Cream Tart 4'': bold lemon flavor but excessively sweet - make sure to spread the whipped cream over the entire tart because it'll help balance out the sugary filling. Possibly meant to shared between 2 people.
Frangipane
Croissant
(almond cream): Tartine is quite generous with the cream, and they do a great job of spreading the cream evenly throughout the pastry instead of just putting a little smear at the center.
Pain au Jambon (ham and cheese
croissant
): excellent breakfast choice that was actually pretty big and filled me up. The saltiness from the ham and cheese was a little overpowering after a while, but it was still yummy!
Pain Au Chocolat (chocolate

A cute little European-inspired bakery that's around the corner from Dolores park and is clearly well known for its breads and pastries. The line is well out the door, but was only about 20 minutes or so on the sunday evening that I went. Depending on the day, street parking is around the area, but as most places in the Mission, it can definitely get crowded. Making it inside, there was a sweet aroma of pastries, and a cozy bustling of baked goods and happy people! There were about three two-person tables on one end of the store, and then a few larger tables for larger parties, or to-share tables. Service was quick, sometimes a bit too quick, and friendly.
FOOD 4/5
I got the Morning bun, Pain Au Chocolat,
Frangipane
Croissant
, and the ever-so-tasty Ham and cheese
croissant
. All for alittle under $20 (Approx. $4-5 per pastry), these were a delectable, carby, sugary pre-dinner meal. The Morning Bun was probably one of my favorite, a many-layered inverted
croissant
roll laminated with a sugary glaze, topped with sugar, cinnamon, and orange zest; it was a perfect balance of sugary, moist yet crunchy goodness! Another top seller for me was the Ham and Cheese
Croissant
. SO GOOD, and such a wonderful contrast to all the sweet. The
croissant
was moist on the inside, with crunchy outer layers; a great balance of ham and cheese on the inside and also made you feel like there was some nutrition with the sliver of protein. Then came the Pain Au Chocolat and
Frangipane
which were both flakey
croissant
goodness as well. The chocolate
croissant
had a 66% cocoa chocolate on the inside which would have tasted so much better if it was warmed up. The
Frangipane
was a lighter
croissant
and a tad on the dry side but did have an amazing brandy soaked layer on the inside that was then topped with
frangipane
cream (an aromatic mix of butter, sugar, pastry cream, slivered almonds, and brandy).
I'll definitely be coming back to try out the paninis though, They were made with AMAZING looking bread and smelled .... indescribable HAHA!
Overall, a good experience, Solid 4/5 stars (: Can't go without that Morning Bun and Ham & Cheese
Croissant

I had the

""It's not the smell, it's not the look, but the sound,"" she tells him, crushing a loaf between her fingers. This statement cemented my dogmatic belief in selecting if bread is good or not. Whether it's pastries, loaves, or any other baked goods, I took this opinion as a matter for my own tasting pleasure.
Before arriving in San Francisco, I was recommended to visit Tartine by a fellow classmate in my summer philosophy class. ""You have to go to Tartine!"" she kept reminding me. Finally, after so much determination on her part, I decided to take on her suggestion when visiting The City after summer semester ended. Apart from getting lost in the Mission District due to my GPS app making me walk in the wrong direction, eventually I was able to find my way to the bakery. Upon entering the establishment, I was taken aback from the smells, the sounds, and the many people that were crammed into this small space. Going up to the counter, I asked the person helping me what he would recommend to a first-time customer. Something sweet and something savory was what I asked of him. He kindly recommended for me their ham and cheese
croissant
for the savory option and their
frangipane
croissant
with almond cream for the sweet. Along with the two, I also picked out their bread pudding because it looked so enticing sitting among the many other treats in display. All three treats along with a small coffee totaled about $21, which I took with a grain of salt being San Francisco, but I can tell you the quality and tastes of the ingredients are very much worth the prices that are set.
Sitting down with my savory
croissant
and coffee, I took Colette Tatou's tip of choosing bread to the test, delicately pressing my fingers on the treat as the pastry crunched to the pressure. My expectations were met and I ripped a piece off, exposing the salty ham and melted cheese that were inside. It was obvious that this was not any ordinary
croissant
, with each layer being flakier than the next. The middle was soft and spongy, having a airy texture on the palette. It was a great pairing with the hot coffee to wash it down.
Overall, this is an excellent bakery you wouldn't want to miss whether you live in the City or a passerby on the way to Dolores Park. The staff is genuinely helpful and the product they make is worth every cent."

// Morning Bun ($4.25) - 5 stars
The perfect marriage of a classic
croissant
and a cinnamon roll, this pastry is what Tartine is best known for. Think of a flaky
croissant
dough that's been rolled up and topped with sugar, cinnamon, and orange zest. These will be sold out come afternoon though - a blessing in disguise since they're best eaten fresh.
// Banana Cream Tart ($7.75 for 4"" / $48 for 9"") - 5 stars
I've always been a sucker for banana flavored pastries, and this one is no different. The bananas are ripe, the cream is succulent, the tart is flaky. Perfectly balanced out with thin slivers of bitter dark chocolate.
//
Croissant
($4.25) - 5 stars
The first thing you realize about a Tartine
croissant
is its ginormous size. The second is the dark brown exterior, almost to the point of being burnt. Don't worry though; this means it's more flavorful. The moment you hear that crunch and crackle while digging your teeth into this treat, you know you're in for a good time.
// Chocolate Éclair ($5.25) - 5 stars
A standard éclair that is excellently done. Packed with vanilla cream and glazed with luscious Valhrona chocolate. Pure decadence.
//
Frangipane
Croissant
($5.25) - 4 stars
Tartine's rendition of the almond
croissant
is filled with
frangipane
cream, which is composed of brandy syrup, pastry cream, and almonds. To finish, it is topped with powdered sugar and more crunchy almonds.
// Ham Quiche ($6.25) - 4 stars
A solid savory option to balance out all the sugar. The body of this quiche is light and silky. I'm pretty sure they use the same crust here as the banana cream tart - so good.
// Bread Pudding ($4.50 small / $7.25 large) - 3 stars
Served piping hot, the bread pudding was my least favorite of the bunch. Although I did enjoy the tartness of the fruits, I thought the pudding itself was too mushy. This off-putting texture made it feel like I was eating scrambled eggs."

croissant
.  The plan was to save the
croissant
to enjoy on my flight back home.  When I was actually on the flight and the carb craving hit, I smiled slyly to myself, thinking that I would get to polish off a flakey, buttery
frangipane
croissant
while everyone else ate tiny mass produced pretzels.  Well, the
croissant
was burnt.  The
croissant
was in the oven too long or the heat was too high or something.   The entire outer 1.5 cm circumference of the
croissant
was brown.  And as I stared at it, I recalled the image of the stack of
croissants
at the Tartine counter. The entire display had
croissants
as dark as the one I was picking apart, trying to salvage it and eating the middle layers only. That thought actually made me more than disappointed since it meant they were selling a tray full of burnt pastries to customers without caring about the quality of today's batch.  Were they thinking they wouldn't need to care about being good every day?  They do have enough loyalty and branding built in that 1 Yelp review doesn't matter.  But Tartine, I made my friend wait with me in that line, with the sun shining at us the entire time.  And the end result was just an over-priced, low quality item."

I was looking for things to satiate my sweet tooth but in the end nothing but the Morning Bun was as sweet as I wanted them to be and was by far the best thing I tasted from there. Other than that the
Frangipane
Croissant
was good (could've been really good if I used butter or anything else on it, like a jam, peanut butter or Nutella) and both the Banana Cream Tart and the
Frangipane
Tart were ok.
- The Bread Pudding barely had any taste;
- The Double Pain au Chocolat wasn't good even on the chocolate parts (which it barely had);
- The Hazelnut Chocolate Tart was very light in flavor, basically and weirdly not sweet - wasn't satisfying, just felt like a placeholder;
- The Cookie was just ""Meh"", I have eaten better from supermarkets;
- The Chocolate Rye Bar barely had any sweetness in the chocolate and in the meringue (not satisfying and not even a pleasant flavor) and came with a crazy sweet and flavored jam that was basically all I could feel whenever I took a bite that had it. It honestly felt like I was drinking orange essence or orange perfume.
I don't get the hype and I don't plan on waiting on that line again. I may go back earlier (much earlier!) for a Morning Bun if it's on my way and I want to show it to someone visiting me."

To my utter disappointment, the sandwich was like eating mush encased in hard pressed greasy bread. You couldn't taste the

Many people enjoy the breads, which can be purchased by the loaf. You may also enjoy such items as ""morning bun,"" ""muffin,"" ""croissant,"" ""cappuccino,"" or ""frangipane tart.""

- Gougere: this delicious light, puffy bread thing with gruyere cheese, pepper & thyme is again amazing
- Morning Bun:  Basically a cinnamon bun, but better! Even this non-sweet tooth loved this

We asked for our snack to go to enjoy in Dolores Park, and our sandwich was cheerfully brought out about 15 minutes later. The cold brew was fine, but in my opinion, it's kind of hard to mess up cold brew. The hefty sandwich oozed out cheese and pesto and was the perfect amount of

So I return in 20 mins my sandwich is plated. Ok so I play dumb and just eat it there. It was SO so.
I finish up and ask where my other stuff is. They say I never paid for it. Really? How about asking me if I paid or not instead of telling me that they don't believe me. I had to pull up my bank statement for them to even look in the system I was pissed. Then they scrolled for about 5 mins finding nothing until that other snooty guy came up and insisted in a very unfriendly way- I gave you your stuff. The girl behind him who had put it away was shaking her head like no he didn't. I told him look I came from LA to eat here and this is just a mess. He didn't even apologize and was rude again saying ""he was trying to fix it"" the manager had skedaddled and wasn't paying attention. Overall it left me with a bad taste in my mouth. On the food network show it portrays the Owners as people who are salt of the earth with real passion. I don't think that attitude transfers to their staff"

This place is worth the wait! There is hope. We came on a sunny Saturday afternoon around 2 PM and waited about 20-25 min to get through the line.
Our party of 3 shared a bunch of things.
We LOVED:
1) the
spicy
turkey
hot pressed sandwich: delicious pesto with yummy gooey melted cheese and the
turkey
actually has a kick that hits you at the end.
2) morning bun: deliciously covered with cinnamon sugar on the outside. It's flaky and crispy on the outside and chewy and soft on the inside. I like the subtle hint of lemon you taste with this too.
3) lemon poppyseed tea cake: the texture is wonderful and the flavor is delicate and delicious. The outer layer has a crust that is lightly crispy with moist cake in the center.
4) banana cream tart: YUM! The flaky pastry bottom has a layer of chocolate!
The pretty good stuff:
1) croque monsieur: not bad, but I think the
spicy
turkey
is better. I heard you can get a fried egg on this sandwich though if you ask for it.
2) sopressata, fontina, broccoli rabe pesto hot pressed sandwich: pretty yummy, but I personally liked the
spicy
turkey
better.
3) Mexican wedding cookies: crispy texture that was not too sweet.
4) chocolate rye cookie: interesting that this is made out of rye. It was not overly sweet, which I appreciated. You could really taste the dark chocolate in this cookie.
And the meh:
1) bread pudding: one of my friends liked it, but I thought it was too eggy and soggy. I've had better elsewhere.
---------------------------------------------------
The hot pressed sandwiches are huge! There are 3 pieces that come in one order. I could only finish 1 out of the 3 pieces b/c I wanted to save room for dessert and coffee! It'll make a yummy future leftover dinner :)
I also got an iced latte which was pretty good and balanced well with the sweets!
As for seating, if you see a seat, grab it! 2 of us stayed in line while the other person in our party went to save a seat that had opened up.
Would love to come back to pick up a loaf of freshly baked bread or to try some other baked goodies. My mom would love this place!"

I commend Tartine for moving the line along fairly quickly and having copies of the menu available for people to look at so that they're ready to order once they're at the front. No extra charge for the carry-out paper bag.
Lemon Cream Tart 4'': bold lemon flavor but excessively sweet - make sure to spread the whipped cream over the entire tart because it'll help balance out the sugary filling. Possibly meant to shared between 2 people.
Frangipane Croissant (almond cream): Tartine is quite generous with the cream, and they do a great job of spreading the cream evenly throughout the pastry instead of just putting a little smear at the center.

pain
au
jambon
(ham-and-cheese croissant), gougere (onion and cheese pastry), lemon cream tart, and banana cream tart (per the many, many recommendations here). May have gotten a few more pastries; I can't recall.
This was definitely NOT a cheap excursion. These 7-8 pastries ran us north of $50-60, tax included.
That said, most everything was good, and several were great. The gougere was a surprise hit, flaky, pungent with onion but not overpowering, and probably a good bet for vegetarians (sorry vegans, I think they contain cheese). The quiche and ham-and-cheese croissant were both very solid.
As I expected from reading the many reviews here, the banana cream tart was far and away the star of the show. Deliciously pudding/custardy texture - not too sweet or too bland, but exactly right. I noticed they have full pie-sized banana cream tarts as well - something to explore later, I think.
Sadly, the lemon tart was the biggest miss. Bland and didn't really have much lemon flavor. Give it a pass.
I didn't find all pastries to be uniformly amazing, the prices were steep, and nobody enjoys waiting in line. If it weren't for those issues, this place would've gotten 5 stars from me. (Also, since this is the Mission, there's no parking to be had either.)
I'll probably be back sometime in future, but unless you're a local with time to kill standing around in line without having to worry about parking, this isn't an everyday visit kind of place."

I yelped around and right knew it had to be Tartine since it had over 6,000 reviews. And yes the pictures were just the type of patisserie I was looking for. I was worried at first because I knew there would be a long crazy line but luckily when we went it was not that bad. I liked the atmosphere, small, but cozy and quaint. Simple and clean. I was overwhelmed because everything looked so good and I wanted it all! I came here twice since first time they were out of a few things and I wanted to come earlier and really get the full experience.
_Frangipane Tart ($6.75) Flaky pastry shell, almond cream with seasonal fruit. This was the first thing I got when I came here, even though my heart wanted the banana cream tart. It looked good, but taste wise was a let down. It tasted average, and a bit try. Not as flaky or buttery and did not have much flavor besides just almond. The fruit was I believe some type of berry. Maybe blueberry or boysenberry, which was not that sweet and the flavors did not really come through. For the price, this was not worth it at all.
_Banana Cream Tart ($7.75) Chocolate and caramel coated flaky pastry. Because I was disappointed with the tart above, I decided to just follow my heart and go for the banana cream tart. It was huge so I originally was afraid to eat it all by myself, since my gf can't have too much sweets, but I'm on vacay so F it! So glad I ended up getting this, because it was the best banana cream tart I've had. Actually I never had a banana cream tart, just pie. The crust is more buttery, flaky and thickThe bananas were fresh, and they added a good amount. The cream was a good ration and not too sweet. The caramel inside was subtle and not too sweet but balanced the other flavors. The chocolate inside seemed dark and rich. Now this is worth the price! The chocolate shavings were amazing as well. A must!
_Pain

Chocolate/Chocolate croissant ($5) I came back second day for this but took this home with me back to LA. I put it in the toaster oven and it was still good. This is a double chocolate croissant, so more chocolate. The chocolate seemed semi dark and a bit more rich and bold than milk chocolate. It was good, but chocolate croissant you can get anywhere, this is good if you just want that sweet pastry.
_Morning Bun ($4.25) Cinnamon sugar, candied orange. A man in front of me said I had to get this, and I'm so glad I did. This was my other fave and a must! It tasted like a cinnamon roll, from the sugar and cinnamon, but definitely not as sweet. It had a candied orange flavor and paste, that was not too much but just enough to give that orange flavor. It brought out more of the cinnamon flavor. And the bread itself was so flaky, buttery and soft. I wish I got two of this because this is something I've never had before.
_Pain
au
Jambon
/Ham and Cheese Croissant ($5.75) Smoked ham, gruyere. Had this as well back home, popped it in the toasted over. The ham was slightly salty and the cheese was not as gooey but I'm sure it would have tasted way better when I ate it fresh that day. Again the croissant was butter and the layers were just crisp throughout. I also love how the croissants are very thick and huge. This pretty much touched the top toasted oven.
_Tea Cake/loaf ($4.25) Lemon almond. I had this back at home two days later, and it was still good! The loaf was still very moist, but It seemed more on the buttery side. The edges had a nice lemon flavor and more on the sweeter side. This would have been good with some tea.
_Quiche slice ($6.25) Ham, seasonal vegetable. This was pretty good! and I only like quiche at Proof Bakery back home, but this was pretty darn close. I find the crust important on quiche, and the one here was buttery and fresh. The ham and veggies were good, although I find it a saltier than what I prefer, but it was filling and perfect for a savory and quick brunch.
Overall everything was great, but I find the prices pretty high. I would definitely come back here again, and I'd say it's worth the wait, but be prepared to spend some $$ for a few pastries."

It took us about 45 minutes to reach the counter, but all the memories of waiting went out the window when we saw all the items displayed. The first items we saw were the desserts and cakes- what a way to start the day!
Without much background information on the bakery (I know, smart move to wait in line and not know what to expect) I was open to almost everything that I saw, and I had to tell myself 100 times that I could not afford to buy everything nor did I have the stomach capacity to eat everything. Sad life.
I ended up grabing a small coconut creme tart, and 3 croissants: a regular, chocolate, and I believe it was the
Pain
au
Jambon
(smoked ham + gruyere). There was no way I could finish all of these, even as someone who can eat a LOT. The croissants are pretty huge, and even after eating the coconut creme tart I could barely eat the other croissants (to compare my friends each could only eat 1 or 1.5 pastries). The tart was out of this world, I'd get this a second, third, x-th time! I believe the banana creme tart was the hype of the tarts at Tartine, but I'm not much of a banana creme tart fan. If it's as magical as the coconut creme tart GO FOR IT!
As other reviewers have mentioned, the croissants are a good size....maybe half the size of my face? My face isn't the smallest.
I almost gave the place a 4/5 because of the line (which really couldn't be helped), and the service (the staff members were informative but hard to catch as they tried to get the line going- I can understand having worked in the food industry, but being skipped over a few times wasn't a fun expeience). The staff were overall very efficient and quick on their feet, and having to work in such a hectic situation of hangry people doesn't make things easier, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed for a better next experience here at a not-so-busy time (*good luck to that*)."

We stopped by around 5 on a monday and we only waited in line for about 30 minutes. We ordered the croissant, hazelnut biscotti, bavarian, and the
pain
au
jambon
. Bavarian was delicious; very light and not overly sweet. Since we were traveling, we saved the others for the morning when we were traveling home. And honestly, they were not stale nor bad. They were all so great. This place definitely lives up to the hype.
We took our order to go. The place is a bit small so if you have a large stroller is difficult to navigate around inside.
It was all worth it and I can't wait to come back to try more!"

We stood in line for the expected long wait time. I think from beginning to the end when we ordered was a total of 45 minutes. I thought since we were there we would live it up and order a couple different things.
We both ordered their ""famous"" morning bun. It was pretty so that's nice. First bite was lite and airy and not so sickly sweet as you would expect from a typical cinnamon roll bakery item. But the second bite lent itself to a hint of citrus that became less hinting and more prominent after each bite. I'm not saying it wasn't good I just personally don't care for that so much.  But it was fairly inexpensive ($4.20 each) which seems reasonable even if you don't care for it.
My husband loves bread pudding so we ordered a small bowl of their brioche bread pudding that came with some fresh strawberries on top and kind of mixed in ($4.25). That also was light which is nice. I'd have to say I definitely prefer strawberries in my bread pudding instead of raisins that's for sure. But brioche bread is sweet to begin with so it was more on the sweet side. If I didn't have the morning bun as well I could probably have eaten more.
I'm obsessed with having to have some kind of egg dish for something to be considered breakfast so I ordered a slice of the vegetable quiche. I really liked the filling, once again it was light and fluffy. The French have a way at keeping things light. I didn't care for the crust. It was burnt in my opinion and didn't leave a nice flavor in my mouth. My husband said my quiche were better- love him forever  and I kinda have to agree.
The last thing we ordered was the
Pain
au
Jambon
w/jalapeño (which they say they only make it that way on the weekend) $5.75. It was by far the best of everything we ordered. They should make it on the weekday as well. The ham was a nice thickness and the Gruyere cheese flavor was there but not over powering. They use a fresh jalapeño and don't remove the seeds so beware. My last bite was a bit spicy. But super yummy. Our total for 5 items came to $27.62. Kinda pricey considering it was just baked goods and we could have had eggs Benedict and omelettes for the same price.
Overall, we can say we have been to this Tartine place but I'm not going to rush back anytime soon. It was good, prices were reasonable, but not waiting in line 30+ minutes for good. You have to at least go once to say you've been."

This place is not worth the 20 minutes I stood in line.  No one writes down what you want, so if you're ordering more than 3 pastries, get ready to have your order wrong when you get to the front.   I think the girl that rang me up was fighting with the girl taking the orders up at the line cause I got most of the attitude directed at her.
Not worth the hype or the money.
Ordered:
2 butter
croissants
6/10
1 pain au chocolat - 4/10
2 eclairs 2/10
1 lemon tart 7/10

croissant
and a cinnamon roll - in full swing!
The Morning Bun alone is reason enough to come back, but the Croque Monsieur with Shiitake Mushroom will make the decision even easier.  Simply put, a croque monsieur is a ham and cheese sandwich - but a lot better.  Their offering came with a choice of ham, turkey, shiitake mushroom, or fromage blanc.  Our order came nicely baked with plenty of mushrooms and melted gruyère cheese.  My younger daughter enjoyed it so much that she wanted a single slice to be her next birthday cake.  We just need to buy some candles!
We also tried the huge Gougère (savory choux pastry with gruyère cheese) and the larger-than-usual Pain au Chocolat (chocolate
croissant
).  They were also delicious, but not as impressive as the other two items we had.  The quiche, scone,
croissant
, cookie, tart, and cake looked appetizing as well, but we would have gone home broke had we decided to try them all.
The wait was long and the prices were steep, but the quality and taste of the food were superior.  Seating oneself could be a challenge, but Mission Dolores Park is just a couple of blocks away.  Enjoy the stroll while slowly nibbling away at that delightful Morning Bun..."

The line moved pretty fast given it's a small space and the line went out the door.
Here's what I got:
Country Bread Loaf: Solid bread loaf, especially when it's just out of the oven. You'll find a thicker/heartier crust, and a dense inside. Flavor is good, but on the mineral-y side for me. It lasted for a few days after too.
Morning Bun: $5 ish(?) This is like a Kouign-Amann got married to a Cinnamon Role and had a gigantic baby with a little bit of almond-flavor/paste-like filling. Overall, very good, although not as memorable as the Kouign-Amann from Dominique's in NYC.
Pain Au Chocolate: Also $5 ish. This was HUGE. Probably the biggest chocolate
croissant
I've ever had, and really good. Worth it for me, but wished there was a little more chocolate on the inside. I would get this again.
Goat Cheese Sandwich: Came with apple slices, and overall good, but would probably try something different.
Didn't get the other things recommended since I was on the road and on the go, but I would definitely try to come back next time to try other things they offer here that others have raved about. Until next time!"

Cookies,
croissants
, pies, I couldn't decide. The guy behind the counter suggested the morning bun because it is their most popular item, so I went with that.
Morning Bun ($4.75): This is like a cinnamon roll in the way the bread has layers, but like a
croissant
in the way the bread pulls apart. It is flavored with cinnamon sugar and candied orange and is on the sweeter side. It took me a couple days to eat it. I really liked the crunch of the sugar granules covering the bun. I think the orange flavor complemented the cinnamon well.

Tried a regular

croissant

May come back later to try some of their other offerings, but not quite sure about the hype after my first visit."

The
croissants

croissant
was too crunchy though, was looking for a bit of fluff in the middle. Morning bun was also very flaky and firm. I don't really eat morning buns though so I don't know how they should taste. The chocolate chip walnut cookie is big but very flat and super crispy. I enjoyed it, despite know all that extra butter is probably the secret to the nice crunch it has.

I've been here at least 6 times so far and have been coming at least twice a month since I've moved here (It's rare that I go anywhere more than once). It also doesn't help that I live a block away from this delightful, delicious bakery.
The pastries they make here are probably the best I've ever had in the city. I'd say my favorite are the almond
croissant
and the banana cream tart. I've also tried the regular
croissant
, chocolate
croissant
, ham and cheese
croissant
, morning bun, buttermilk scone, lemon meringue cake, ham and egg quiche and the croque monsieur with ham.
So I'll speak about the
croissants
in general. The
croissants
they create here are HUGE, you might think that $5 is crazy for a
croissant
but I've paid $5 for
croissants
that are half the size. Here, they are super sized and can be a meal in itself! The
croissants
have a dry, crunchy surface that breaks super easily, but a warm, cozy, fluffy inside that almost melts in your mouth. Their
croissants
here are so good and you'd be fine choosing any
croissant
.
The banana cream tart is even more filling, it really satisfies the craving for any sweet tooths out there. It comes with banana, whipped cream, caramel, chocolate flakes and a whole bunch of other goodness. One of the best tarts I've ever had.
All the other things I've tried all of them are pretty solid. Things that were pretty average were the morning bun and their scones, but still pretty decent.
Honestly, you can't go wrong here! When in doubt, any of the things first listed in it's section is pretty solid.
Also prepare to wait here! Unless you come really early. There is often a line that can take anywhere from 10 - 30 minutes before when you line up and when you pay for your order. Also don't come too late because they usually run out of the best things early on."

My big recommendation is the morning bun, which is out-of-this world good. Like really really good. Most likely the best pastry I've ever had.

+ Baked Chocolate Soufflé, 5/5
Glazed Oysters w/ Caviar: delicious (duh!). Wanted to try the risotto but I love me some oysters. Love how it's slightly cooked but still maintains the texture of a raw oyster.
Duck
Breast
: phenomenal. Tender and a perfect medium-rare. Generous portions paired with a nice
duck
hash and purée.
Baked Soufflé: fluffy. I've had several soufflés in the past and was never really a fan. But WOW! I loved my soufflé, ate it all without the two sauces. Not overly sweet, fluffy all around with a moist/mushy center. I guess I do like soufflés but only at Gary Danko."

We were in our very early 20s and working our minimum wage jobs, wishing that one day we could eat here. Fast forward to present time, my husband surprised me for my 30th birthday and booked a table here.
We had a 9:30pm reservation and from the beginning to end, the service was spectacular. We arrived 10 mins early and were seated right away. They sat us next to each other against the wall in view of everybody. As our host said, ""Great seats for people watching.""
My husband and I chose the 4 course meal and I love how you're not limited to each section of the menu. There were many options and we wanted to try as much as we could, so we both got different things. We each ordered an appetizer, seafood and 2 meat dishes. The food was soooo good. A lot of the things we ordered were things we both were trying for the first time.
We ordered the risotto, seared foie gras, seared scallops, roast maine lobster, juniper crusted bison, filet of beef, stuffed quail and
lemon
pepper
duck
breast
. Although they were all delicious, the highlights of the meal were the risotto, seared foie gras,
duck
breast
and bison. The dishes were timed and spaced out perfectly throughout the evening. We didn't feel like we had to wait too long in between entrees, nor did we feel rushed. At the end of our meal, they gave us a small tray of mini desserts and a complementary birthday dessert. They also gave us a pumpkin cream cheese muffin to take home, which was a nice touch.
Overall, my husband and I had a great time and both agreed that this was our favorite dining (and fanciest) experiences to date. It was a great way to celebrate my birthday! We left the restaurant at almost midnight. Those 2 hours flew by and we didn't even realize it because we were having such a great time. No phones, just quality time, good food and good conversation. We will definitely be back."

Don't hesitate. Book the reservation. It's the most bang for your buck Michelin star experience you'll get. The service is amazing and the food is even better. Do it. And then read reviews to figure out what dishes you want.
Seriously, one of my favorite dining experiences EVER. Worth every penny you spend here (and more!!!)
We came here for our joint 30th birthdays. After much thought, we decided that GD has been one of our top 5 dining experiences and that there was no better place to spend our birthdays.
We each ordered the 5 course dinner.
Salt Cured Foie Gras Torchon with Peach Compote (his) - The lesser of the two foie dishes, but still delicious. I wish there was more bread for the foie, but that is our only gripe with this dish.
Seared Foie Gras with Caramelized Onions & Black Mission Figs (mine) - oh my God. Get this. The onions, foie, and figs pair perfectly for an explosion in your mouth. 10/10 would get again.
Roasted Sea Scallops (mine) - I got this dish last time, and got it again this time. It never disappoints and is always delicious. The cook on the scallop is perfect and it's tender and juicy.
Roast Maine Lobster (his) - If I wasn't mildly allergic to lobster, this would have been my dish. The components of this dish really seal the deal. The lobster was cooked well and not gummy.
Seared Filet (his) - Probably our least favorite dish of the evening, but even then, it's something we enjoyed. The cook (medium rare) was great and the basil butter - excellent.
Pan Seared Bass (mine) - I ordered this even though I'm not a fan of bell
peppers
OR capers...but seriously, I am so impressed. I cleared my plate and finished it ALL. Impressive especially if you know me and know that I will pick the tiniest piece of bell
pepper
out of ANY dish.
Lemon
Pepper
Duck
Breast
(mine) - I will admit that by this course, I was feeling fully stuffed and needed to save room for dessert. So I took a taste and asked them to box it up for me. Even as my lunch the next day...it was delicious. Best lunch EVER. Note: GD's
duck
has been my favorite dish out of any
duck
dish I've had...even internationally. Don't miss out.
Trio of Creme Brulee (mine) - My favorite dessert is creme brulee. If it's on the menu, I'll get it. THREE of them? Sold. The flavors this time were vanilla, bourbon, and ginger. The vanilla was wonderful - can't ever go wrong with the OG. The bourbon was to DIE for. It tasted like caramel and flan - it was just the right amount of gooey and melt in your mouth. It was super sweet though. The ginger one was the only one that was slightly disappointing. It had a little too much bite and was overpowering.
I love the take home cake they send you with. They used to only give it to the women in the dining party, but this time they gave us TWO!!!! Mmmm mmm mm pineapple cake for breakfast the next morning. Not gonna lie, the take home cake plays a HUGE role in my decision to come back to GD.
Service is impeccable - but that's exactly what you should expect from somewhere as old school as GD. The last time we came, I was in a soft cast for my foot and they were super accommodating with my temporary handicap.
This time, one of our entrees took a little longer than they expected. We didn't mind since we understand that Saturday nights are busy. But they comped a glass for wine for me and a glass of fancy Merlot grape juice for my boyfriend.
I can't wait to come back here again - it's still one of my (our) favorite dining experiences/meals. Goal: try every menu item and every cheese on the cheese cart."

Now I'm still poor but have a much more hedonistic attitude towards the places I eat, which is what led me to make a reservation months in advance at Gary Danko for my friend's and my birthday dinner.
Gary Danko is very classy ""old SF,"" from the suited up waiters to the candlelit booths. Plus the windows are totally blacked out, so it feels like you're dining at midnight. The tables are pretty far apart so you have to really lean to have a conversation. Our waiter had an incredibly calming voice and pulled out the table so we could squeeze into our seats (tables are pretty close together). Despite all this, the highlight of the service was the sourdough bread boy. He really kept 'em coming with the refills of bread, and every time I finished my two slices, he would reappear like a genie and plunk two more pillowy slices of bread onto my plate with his tongs.
We went for the $96 3 choices from the menu and went crazy on the meat. We said screw it to the appetizers and ordered the Stuffed Quail, Bison,
Lemon
Pepper
Duck
, Sea Bass, Lobster, and Chocolate Souffle. In order of favorites, mine were:
Stuffed quail: so much flavor crammed into this little bird
Lemon
pepper
duck
: super tender and came with a little potato cake of crispy potatoes and more
duck
Bison: this thing was HUGE. We were worried we wouldn't be full, but along comes this plate of 3 slabs of bison meat and some fat mushrooms. If you're worried you won't be full off 3 courses, order the bison.
Lobster: super buttery, but the showstopper was the mashed potatoes. They were so creamy and specked with corn
Sea bass: undercooked. Don't order.
The chocolate souffle belongs in a whole other category. I'm not a huge fan of chocolate, but oh man with the vanilla and chocolate sauce soaked into a pillowy interior, this souffle was incredible. We also got a
lemon
mousse cake for our birthdays, and a plate of sweets that they always deliver at the end of the meal. The pineapple cake they give you as a going away gift is perfect with tea or coffee for breakfast the next day!"

Sweet corn soup which was very flavorful-nice start to everything.
Seared ahi tuna dish would've been amazing if the tuna was up to par. The avocado and

Sea scallops were small and not very exciting flavor wise. Horseradish salmon was great! The cucumbers and mustard sauce were perfectly proportioned to enhance the salmon. I wish I would've ordered 2.

duck
wasn't anything to rave about and the filet was pretty standard-but appreciated the touch of Swiss chard.

Was sent home with the most adorable upside down pineapple cakes which were perfect with coffee the next morning. Moist and flavorful but small enough you don't feel guilty.... who am I kidding I never feel guilty about sweets.

Went this past Sunday since my friend wanted to treat so I couldn't pass that up. Our reservation was for 9:30pm but they were running behind so we grabbed drinks at the bar. A ""little"" behind turned into being a 30 minute wait. The manager or whoever apologized and offered us complimentary rose and mentioned that we would get a couple complimentary appetizers and dessert as well. That was a nice gesture, but what would've been nice was for him to comp our drinks that we bought at the bar instead. Just my preference vs the free champagne/small ass appetizers aka two teaspoons of soup and a small raw salmon bite on a circular cookie looking thing? It was ok. I really wanted to fall in love with this place but it's overhyped for sure. My favorite dishes were the roast main lobster, scallops, seared foie gras, dungeoness crab salad, and all the desserts (Flambeed cheeries with tres leches cake,
lemon
souflee cake, and the pineapple cake they give you to take home). The filet of beef was meh the sides on there tasted better and the
lemon

Such a random thought, but halfway through the dinner I was thinking that I'd rather go to House of Prime rib lol. Overall, I didn't come super hungry, but I thought the portions are a little small for my liking. Nice presentation and service here, but I think this was just a one time thing for me.

I love the fact that you can choose whatever you want on the menu based on how many courses you chose.
My boyfriend chose a 5 course and I chose a 4 course and you can pick all entrees, all appetizers, all desserts (if you choose, nobody will judge you). So what we did was order basically 1 of whatever we wanted to try and shared it!
We ordered:
Foi Gras
Risotto
Pan Seared Bass
Seared Sea Scallops
Herb Crusted Lamb
Lemon
Pepper
Duck
Pork Tenderloin
Juniper Crusted Bison
Chocolate souffet
If I were to rank my top 3 favorite of the course it would be:
1. Seared Sea scallops - probably the best scallops I've ever had! I couldn't stop thinking about it even when we left
2 Foi Gras - Very tasty - a good idea would to put it on the bread that they provided for you (we actually would have done that if we knew, we only know after we finished the foi gras but heard the table next to us do it!)
3.
Lemon
Pepper
Duck
- The
duck
was tender and tasty, definitely recommended!
If I were to rank my top 3 that I did not like it would be:
1. Juniper Crusted Bison- This was waaay too tough for me so I didn't like it and tasted a bit bland.
2. Pork Tenderlion- This was actually really tender but I thought it was too bland.
3. Risotto - I thought their risotto was just ok.
After our meal, they gave us a mini plate of small assorted desserts and goodies to take home! This place left such a great impression that I would go again."

Ambiance - 3/5
Food - 4/5
Overall experience for this visit would be 3.5 stars, but I'll round up to 4 until I return for another experience.
Came here with my family to celebrate my mom's birthday. We arrived separately; my family arrived ~15 mins before scheduled time (they got sited right away, which was nice), I arrived ~5 mins late to the reservation.
When I arrived to the restaurant, there was no one at the entrance to greet me, I had to look around the room for my family and walk myself to the table.
After I've sat down, we waited at least 15~20 mins before our waiter checked-in with us and started explaining the menu. I understand that they were waiting for everyone to be here before talking about the menu, but I'm shocked that they waited almost 20 mins before they stopped by. (Maybe they didn't notice that I have arrived? or forgot that we have yet to order?)
Our waiter was very nice once we started interacting with him, he gave recommendations throughout the ordering process and checked-in with us a couple times throughout the meal. However the waitress who was refilling water and bread might have a wrong understanding of ""good service"". She was doing everything super fast; pouring water way too fast (splashing water everywhere), putting (or more like throwing) bread down on your plate. Fast service is part of good service, but not all of it; I was constantly distracted/surprised by her quick movement around the table and was concerned that she would splash water on my food or on me. The sommelier who came to help us was even worse. He was rude and had an attitude that he didn't want to help us (maybe because of the price of the bottle we were looking at?) He told us he will look in the cellar for a recommendation, but didn't return until 15 mins later; during that time we saw that he was pouring wine for other tables, we actually thought that he decided to ignore us because we were ordering a cheap bottle.
I will give it to them that our wine glass, water glass, and bread plate were never empty throughout.
The ambiance wasn't that great either. Table arrangements are pretty crowed (waiters have to squeeze sideways between my chair and the person sitting behind me to get through) and background noise is pretty loud (to the point where I have to lean in for the person across me to hear me), not what I expected from a fine dinning restaurant with a Michelin star. There are many restaurants that serve the same quality food, and have better service and ambiance.
The food in general were pretty good, here's a quick rating for the food I order/ try.
Risotto with Rock Shrimp, Dungeness Crab, Asparagus and Beech Mushrooms 4/5
Roast Maine Lobster with Potato Purée, Black Trumpet Mushrooms, Edamame and Tarragon 5/5
Seared Sea Scallops with English Pea Purée, Leek Fondue, Mint and Shimeji Mushrooms 4/5

In the nickel n dime East Bay I was born and raised
On the San Fran streets is now where I spend most of my days
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
Rollin in my whip sometimes Uber Pool
When a couple of Yelpers who were up to no good
Started flaggin my reviews in ma neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my wifey got scared
I said 'Relax honey I'm taking ya to Gary Danko to hobnob with da folks from Bel Air'
...........
What to order at Gary Danko for a first timer? I agonized over this and spent much more time than I should of thinking about this.
I like lists/rankings (as those of you who follow me know) ...since they make decisions easier for me...so I turned this decision making process into the Research Project I dubbed  ""Gary Danko number of times someone indicated this was their favorite dish"" game.
I did a very very (did I say very) un-scientific ranking based on going over a ton of Yelp reviews of friends/well written reviews. I didn't do a spreadsheet but I tried to list them based on how frequent I felt they were mentioned. Typically I do this rough calculcation/analysis in my head but I wanted to get it down on paper because there were so many darn dishes to choose from.
Rank below is based on the # of instances I believed people mentioned the dish as their favorite dish. Risotto seemed to be winner...on down.
1)Risotto 2) Pan Seared Scallops 3)Roasted Quail 4)
Lemon
Pepper
Duck
Breast
5)Roast Maine Lobster 6)Coconut Thai Curry 7) Foie Gras
8)Cheese Plate 9) Roasted Pork Tenderloin and Belly 9) Loin of Lamb
10)Sea Bass
So knowing that and knowing I had a hot date (my wife). I went with the decision making process below. This would achieve my primary goal of getting to try as many dishes as possible.
Step 1  (Create List Ranking)  above
Step 2: I then asked the wifey to let me know what she was ordering. Key step ...happy wife = happy life.
Step 3 : She listed Risotto, Seared Beef, Dungeness Crab Salad
Step 4:  I requested that she bump up 5 courses so we could taste more things. It helped that I was treating : o P
Step 5: So basically I eliminated  Risotto from my rankings. She also picked two dishes that were not on my list (Seared Beef and Dungeness Crab Salad) darn! But hey see above..happy wife= happy life.
Step 6: We still had 7 courses to play with so we went straight down the list . I added Sea Bass only b/c I love Seabass.
So after that initial selection here is how I felt the dishes were (re-ranked for your viewing pleasure) from fave  to least fave. I also put in parentheses what I perceived to be their rank before dinner.
Rod's Gary Danko Dish Rankings:
#1 Fave--Pan Seared Scallops (2)-- so soft and tasty great sauce  Cannellini Bean Puree.  Best scallops I've had
2-- Foie Gras (7) --Soft like butter Carmelized Onions and Apples bring a great dynamic.
3--Pan Seared Sea Bass (11) - The Clam Succotash  , sweet potato puree  and shallots the seabass sits on top of were also super tasty.
4-- Coconut Thai Curry (6) - Nice Presentation. The waitress bring  sauce in a mini pot and pours the sauce over the Candied Peanuts and Shitake Mushrooms. The Curry sauce is a seafood medley of Shrimp, Calamari, Lobster and Scallops that taste delicious
5-- Risotto (1)Everything goes well together and almost tastes like a fancier Filipino Dish Arroz Caldo. This where my ""must order for next time line is""
..................
6-- Roasted Quail (3) - This is more about the things that are stuffed ( Mushroom Ragout, Leeks, quinoa and Foie Gras with Fingerling Potatoes and Porcini Cream) than it is about the actual Quail. I mean this was good but not amazing to me.
7-- Dungeness Crab Salad ( NR) Another nice presentation and taste combo with Melons, Cucumbers, Roasted Eggplant and Thai Mango dressing. Wifey insisted that she had a ""light salad"" so that's how this made it as a selection. Once again see above...happy wife= happy life.
8-- Roast Maine Lobster (5) - good ,savory but clearly behind scallops n sea bass in my eyes in the ""seafood category""
9--
Lemon
Pepper
Duck
Breast
(4)  Bacon Braised Endive and Cardamom Poached pears were an interesting combo. I thought the dish was decent but not very flavorful as other dishes and would not order again.
#10 least fave but still o.k.-- Seared Beef (NR) last  Gnocchi was tasty and the Swiss Char and Stilton Butter are nice touches but just was not a fan of this dish. Would not order again

After Dinner:
I requested a Lyft  and when it came near
The license plate said 'Fresh' and it had dice in the mirror

But I thought ""Nah, forget it, yo holmes, to San Tung!"""

Dinner work like this: you get to choose 3 courses for 89, 4 courses for 109, and 5 for 128. You can mix and match any number of apps, main courses, and desserts that you want. 5 course meal of 5 main plates? No problem. 3 course meal of all the same app? You can do that too. The menu comes with 5 sections. Apps, fish and seafood, meats and game birds, cheese , and dessert.
We ordered
Apps 1. Glazed oysters and caviar. 2. Dungeness crab salad with avocado over a bed of quinoa.
Seafood. 3. Branzini with fennel puree. 4. Seared scallops and lentils.
Meats. 5.
Lemon
pepper
duck
breast
. 6. Roasted stuffed quail with mushrooms and foie gras.
7. Cheese board.
8. Trio of creme brulee.
We were more than stuffed at the end.
1. The glazed oyster dish comes with 4 oysters over a bed of Ossetra caviar. While the oysters were OK in this leek ceam sauce, the caviar tasted amazing. Light, rich, and just melts in your mouth. I would order this dish again for the caviar in the leek sauce alone. 4/5.
2. Dungeness crab salad. While I wasnt overly impressed by the oysters, this salad was the whole package. Instead of fine chopping crab into small chunks that you might see in other salads, here you have 2 large pieces of crab over 2 pieces of grapefruit and avocado. What a combination that was. I think my new favorite way of eating crab now with grapefruit! The quinoa was OK as was the vinaigrette. They gave a bit too mich quinoa...but hey, when is too much a bad thing? =p 4/5.
3. Branzini is our favorite white fish so this one was an easy selection for us. Oh and the saffron orange emulsion mixed with fennel puree? Yea it was that good. She doesn't like olives and Im not a huge fan either, but the ones in this dish were not as sour or sharp as other olives I had. 5/5.
4. Scallops happen to be one of my favorite things to eat and Gary Danko does not disappoint. Two large perfectly seared scallops  with potatoes, roasted
peppers
and a light curry vinaigrette makes this an easy 5/5. Everything just works in this dish.
5. The
duck
breast
came with
duck
hash, poached pears, and a delicious garlic puree. While every individual compnent was excellent individually, I wasn't sure exactly how to tackle this dish. Too many complex tastes here! Still the generous portion size is tough to beat 5/5.
6. The roasted quail with stuffed mushroom and foie gras really hit the spot. The resturant keeps you filled with sourdough bread and what better way to eat the soft bread than with a spread of foie gras? Oh yea, the pumpkin orzo, truffle corn bread, and glazed apple were nice, too lol. What a dish. 5+/5.
7. Here I have to apologize. Im not a cheese person and good cheese is wasted on me. =(((.
8. So the trio of creme brulee ended up being quite filling. Vanilla, ginger,  and burbon. Highly recommend!
Overall, 5/5. Cheers!"

Pretty difficult to find parking as you can expect. It was super cold that evening and we were lucky enough to snag a parking spot only a block and a half away. They offer valet service for $20 if you aren't lucky with parking.
The restaurant's exterior wasn't what I had imagined for some reason. You couldn't see anything in the restaurant as all the windows were tinted black. We were in for a surprise, but a wonderful one. It was very elegant inside. We came a few minutes past our reservation time as we made a quick pit stop to Patagonia a block away. Our reservation time was 5:30 which was when they opened. I was surprised to see so many people sitting down already. That was fast.
You have the option of choosing the tasting menu or a 3-4-5 course meal. We went for the 4-course meal. What I loved about this option was that even though you were given the option of appetizers, seafood, meats, and desserts, you could choose four of ANYTHING. It doesn't necessarily have to go in what you'd think as the proper sequence (appetizer, entree, dessert), although you could do it that way if you wanted to. It could be four entrees... all lobster if you wanted! I skipped out on the appetizers and went straight to the entrees, heh.
Originally I had ordered four entrees, BUT when I got to my third course, I started getting a bit full. Luckily, they were still able to change my fourth course into a dessert rather than the seared filet of beef I had ordered. The waiter recommended getting a dessert when I was placing my initial order as my fourth course since it was my first time, but I definitely overestimated my appetite and turned down the dessert option. He knew all along, ha. Anyways - what I had ordered was the roast maine lobster, seared sea scallops,
lemon
pepper
duck
breast
, and the chocolate souffle with two sauces. I think my top two favorites were the scallops and the
duck
breast
. Both were so tender. Although the lobster was good (such a drastic change from the horrible overcooked lobster I had at that buffet in Reno omg), lobster never seems to wow me just because I've never been a huge fan of it. My boyfriend order the roast maine lobster, coconut thai curry with an assortment of seafood, herb crusted loin of lamb, and the
duck
breast
as well. His coconut thai curry tasted more like a bisque than it did curry, but was still very good. I definitely wouldn't have ordered dessert as my fourth course if I knew we were going to be served an assortment of tiny desserts along with the free birthday dessert for my boyfriend.
At the end of our meal, we were given these nicely packaged desserts to take home with us. They were banana cream cheese cakes I believe!
Honestly, I would have been content with a 3-course meal.. it was too much food for one night! I guess it really depends on what you order and how hungry you really are.
Food was great, definitely super filling if you order the right things. Service was top notch. That's the one thing that stood out the most for me. Water was refilled almost instantly. And so was the bread. I found it kind of funny that my bread was refilled within a second of grabbing my final piece. They were so on top of everything, I loved it!
Definitely a great place to celebrate a special occasion!"

Me and my bf did the 5 course meal, cause we were thinking if this place is super expensive and we don't get to go here often, why not go all out and try everything. Most people would probably do fine with the 4 courses, as me and my bf were both really full by the end and we do eat a lot. Before I forget valet parking is $20 but you can definitely find street parking nearby (although it may be a limit of 2 hours)
In terms of menu items:
Seared foie gras with carmelized onions and apples - 10/10!!!!
omg this was the tastiest thing I have ever eaten in my life. the foie gras was super delectable and soft and filled with lots of flavor. It was small, but it was definitely one of my top choices after trying the other things I picked
Risotto with rock shrimp - 6.5/10
I'm not sure if I'm a fan of risotto, I may not be as I thought this was a little salty. My bf however thought it was really really good!
Seared scallops - 10/10!!
These scallops tasted so good and was super soft with every bite. I felt like I was eating a meal from hells kitchen LOL. There was also this thing in the middle that I couldn't tell what it was, some sort of potato cake? It was super good too. I couldn't exaclty figure out the flavors but this was both one of me and my bf's favorite dish. definitely recommend this one if you're going here.
Horseradish crusted salmon medallion with dilled cucumbers and mustard sauce - 8/10
The salmon was super soft and not fully cooked, which was good cause it wasn't dry like other salmons  you would have at other restaurants. I like dill so I automatically enjoyed this dish, and the mustard sauce was tangy and gave you a kick too. I enjoyed the scallops more though.
Roasted Quail with stuffed mushroom and pumpkin orzo - 10/10!!!
This was probably my favorite dish out of the whole night! I thought the quail would be too much work but it wasn't and the stuffing in there was super tasty! the quail itself was sweet and nicely roasted as well. the pumpkin orzo was a good addition too. this is the other dish i would definitely recommend getting here!!
Lemon
Pepper
duck
breast
with pears - 9/10
The
duck
itself was good but it was paired with some sort of crabcake which kind of confused me and my bf cause it felt like it didn't go together, but it was nice that they included it anyway LOL. and the pears were pretty good too and they had some sort of fried fats on the side which went well with the dish. I think if the crabcake didn't throw me off I would have given this a 10/10 though.
Herb crusted loin of lamb with dates - 10/10
This was a lot better than i was thinking! I don't like lamb much but this dish didn't taste too gamey or anything, and the stuff underneath it was good too! another one i would recommend that you have to try when you come here.
Seared Filet of beef with gnocci - 6/10
Both me and my bf didn't really enjoy this too much, but i think its cause we realized we don't like filet. it was nicely cooked but i think the cut was just too thick for us so at one point it was just like eating raw meat. the potato gnocci was good but that's about it.
Flambeed pineapple with olive oil and rosemary cake  10/10
this dessert was definitely exotic and you get a show right in front of you! it's an extra $6 but definitely worth it.
Grand marnier souffle - 6/10
this didn't impress me and I guess it just felt like too much egg white? or maybe I just never had a graasp on what souffle was but both me and my bf did not enjoy this as much LOL so i would recommend the other desserts.
Espresso Martini - 8/10
This was definitely a unique drink that I recommend if you are going to get a drink! ive never seen it anywhere else and it literally was a mix of both espresso and martini.
Besides the food, even though I didn't think every dish was 10/10, service was very good and the whole restaurant was super sophisticated and there were some amazing dishes, and  that was enough for me to give 5/5 on our whole experience. our total bill with tip and tap ended up being around $400 but that was mainly bc we got 3 drinks and got the 5 course. definitely will come back here one day when i have a real job!
OVERALL: get the seared scallops, roasted quail, foie gras, herb crusted lamb, and flambeed pineapple!"

It still remains my favorite 1 Michelin Star restaurant, but I thought that this time was a little less of an incredible/amazing/out-of-this-world experience than when I was here last November. There were no missteps that I can point to, but for some reason I didn't feel like the service was quite as on point as previously (although it was still very, very attentive), and the portion sizes were a bit smaller. Our group of 3 ordered 3 courses each ($89; 4 courses is $109 and 5 courses is $128; you can order any combination of appetizers, entrees, or desserts). We got the following:
Appetizers:
Seared Foie Gras with Caramelized Onions and Apples: 5/5. The foie gras is so buttery, rich, and succulent. My only disappointment is that it was about 1/3 of the size of the foie gras that we had here in November. Maybe with rising prices the portion size got smaller?
Poached Farm Egg ""Carbonara"" with Braised Bacon and Brioche: 3/5. Probably my least favorite dish of the night. It was fairly small and while the egg was creamy and cooked perfectly, I didn't think that it had any very special twist to it that made it stand out.
Seafood:
Roast Maine Lobster with Potato Purée, Blood Orange, Edamame and Basil: 4/5 the lobster was very tender and went well with the puree. Beautifully presented.
Seared Sea Scallops with Lentils, Roasted
Peppers
, Potatoes, Parsley and Madras Curry Vinaigrette: 5/5. The scallops were so tender and full of flavor. One of my favorite dishes.
Meat:
Seared Filet of Beef with Potato Gnocchi, Olive Oil, Swiss Chard and Stilton Butter: 4/5. A word of warning that the butter has blue cheese on it, and so has quite a tangy taste to it. The filet is cooked medium rare and is very tender.
Roasted Quail Stuffed with Mushrooms, Truffled Corn Bread and Foie Gras with Pumpkin Orzo and Glazed Apples: 5/5. one of my favorite dishes. The skin was deliciously crispy, the meat juicy, and the stuffing had a variety of flavors.
Lemon
Pepper
Duck
Breast
with
Duck
Hash, Celeriac-Garlic Purée, Belgian Endive and Cardamom Poached Pears: 5/5. One of my other favorite dishes. I just love
duck
, and the
duck
hash was excellent as well!
Herb Crusted Loin of Lamb with Farrotto, Medjool Dates, Rainbow Carrots and Green Chermoula: 4/5. The meat had an interesting flavor. It had a little bit of gaminess, but not too much.
Dessert:
Chilled Peanut Butter Bar with Dark Chocolate Ganache, Feuilletine and Pretzel Ice Cream: 5/5. Excellent! Very salty, but that was refreshing against the sweetness and richness of the chocolate.
They also brought out a complimentary amouse bouche, a complimentary birthday dessert, a complimentary set of assorted mini-desserts, and a complimentary pineapple banana cake for each person to take home. Overall, a great restaurant to go to for special occasions!"

Upon arriving, we were seated promptly at a table side-by-side. It was obvious that the space of the restaurant is small, and this was their modish attempt to save some room. It was totally fine though because I love dining *next* to my boyfriend just as much as across from him :p
A wait staff came over straightaway with a wine menu for us to look over. Although the wine menu was super extensive, it was well organized and easy for me to pick one fairly quickly. Another wait staff came by to offer us the current food menu and explained quickly the ""rules"" which is that there aren't really any -- you can pick and choose from any section for your 3, 4, or 5-course meals and they adjust the portions accordingly. We opted to get a 4 course meal each, one from each of the sections anyway and it was plenty filling for both of us. After everything was ordered, another wait staff came by with the half bottle of wine that I had ordered and allowed me to try some first before I got ""stuck"" with it. In general, I knew that I liked Cabs and red blends so I knew the blend that I picked wouldn't do me any injustice -- one small taste later and both our wine glasses were appropriately filled with delicious red wine.
The wait staff rotated constantly so we weren't able to ""bond"" with one, but that's OK too because maybe they figured out how to be the most efficient in a small space -- everyone was extremely attentive and professional, and knowledgeable of both the food menu and wine menu and despite our indecisiveness, we were quickly able to choose quickly with a bit of their help. Our food came out quickly and our plates were cleaned off and reset based on the dish we selected.
* * * Appetizers * * *
// Risotto with Rock Shrimp, Dungeness Crab, Summer Squash
This was so yummy, I love seafood and so shrimp/dungeness crab risotto was the obvious choice for me for the first course. My boyfriend took a small bite and enjoyed it as well. Funnily, even though he's extremely allergic to shrimp, this was the dish he craved the next day.
// Seared Foie Gras with Caramelized Onions and Cherries
Actually my first time that I tried foie gras -- This was a small but appropriately portioned, juicy, fatty, melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness. Definitely one of those things you indulge in once in awhile to spoil yourself. Must-try if you've never tried foie gras!!
* * * Fish and Seafood * * *
//Roast Maine Lobster
More seafood, my 2nd course pick. The lobster was so fresh, so tender. This set the new standard for all things seafood for me... The texture was absolutely perfect, but unfortunately the meaty part was probably only the size of my finger. Until next time..
//Horseradish Crusted Salmon Medallion with Dilled Cucumbers and Mustard Sauce
Hm, I generally really enjoy Salmon, unfortunately (or fortunately) everything else was so exquisite that the salmon was largely overshadowed and I don't recall it being super out-of-this world. Perhaps sea bass would have been the better choice here.
* * * Meat and Game Birds * * *
//Juniper Crusted Bison with King Trumpet Mushrooms
Mmm bison. Another first for me... Actually I may have tried this in an exotic sausage or something (heh..heh) This was cooked to perfection, rare and juicy on the inside, cooked and seasoned intensely flavorful on the outside. This was also a win for me.

Lemon
Pepper
Duck
Breast
with
Duck
Hash, Bacon Braised Endive and Port Glazed Cherries
I don't usually go for
duck
. I'm perfectly happy with chicken, but this... was pretty much life-changing. They sliced the mound of
duck
breast
thinly but each thin slice still managed to retain its flavors. I was honestly pretty surprised how much I liked this! Good recommendation from our waiter to get this over the pork!
* * * Desserts * * *
//Trio of Crème Brûlée with Assorted Cookies
Who doesn't love crème brûlée?? And it comes with 3 different types..? Sold!
//
Lemon
Soufflé Cake with Crème Fraîche Panna Cotta and Raspberry Sorbet
The tartness of the
lemon
helped balance out the sweetness of this one, however it was still a tad sweeter than I would have preferred. Ending up taking this home and had it the next afternoon anyway because this was still heavenly to these taste buds.
Dessert-wise... My *complimentary* birthday chocolate mousse was surprisingly my favorite here, and I'm not even normally a chocolate-loving person (too sweet 90% of the time). However, their rendition of a chocolate cake/mousse seems to have been made with a flawless blend of rich dark chocolate and other ingredients that I became unreservedly in love with its divine taste. As if the complimentary birthday cake wasn't enough, they also brought us a small platter of assorted cookies (petit fleurs), AND gave us each a pineapple breakfast muffin to have the next morning!! From service to ambiance to the food selection and quality, everything was A+++."

We made reservations 3 weeks in advance where the staff informed us what available dates and times they had and they even called us a day before our reservation as a friendly reminder. If you're worried about parking, don't be. There are plenty of options around the area with their own valet parking for $20, a parking garage up the block, or metered street parking good for up to 4 hours until 7pm. we were lucky to have found metered parking down the block in a heavy traffic area.
Upon arrival we3 were greeted by the host and seated promptly. Our waiter asked if we've dine at Gary Danko before and we replied that we have not and he kindly went through all of our options and answered every questions we had. You basically choose your preferred amount of courses and pick any item on the menu. If you chose a 3 course you can grab 3 desserts or 3 entrees etc you're not limited to getting 1 appetizer, 1 entree and 1 dessert you can choose whatever you like. Our waiter also stated that they don't recommend all meat/poultry dishes for your courses but, if we wanted to, they won't decline to give it to you.
Food review:
I went with the 3 course meal and my partner with 4 courses. We were also given a lot of free stuff (along with every diner in the restaurant) compliments from the chef. We were given a pea soup appetizer, for dessert we were given assortment of chocolate and sweets, and a parting cake gift.
My selection consisted of: Glazed oyster with osetra caviar with zucchini pearls, leeks and lettuce cream, Roast Maine lobster with potato puree, chanterelle mushrooms, corn and tarragon, and Herb Crusted Loin of Lamb with Summer Vegetable Tian and Polenta. They were all done very well and I would recommend any of these dishes all the meats were cooked perfctly medium rare and just melted in my mouth like butter. They were pretty small in portions and wondered if i would be full and if I made the right choice with a 3 course meal but, luckily the loin of lamb did the job!
My partner ordered the Ahi Tuna, Seared foie gras, with caramelized onions, and cherry,
Lemon
pepper
duck
breast
with
duck
hash, bacon braised endive and port glazed cherries, and the Trio of Creme brulee. All were done amazingly and much heartier than my choices. The only dish that was underwhelming for me was the Ahi Tuna, Where the cumin was really present and the lime juice made the dish really acidic as well.
The old fashion I ordered was perfectly mad and one of the best I've had and the Moscow Mule was plenty strong.
End food review
The staff were all exquisite and attentive and could be the best service I've had in a restaurant. There will be two main impressions people will have about Gary Danko the Restaurant either you will love it or you'll think it's just okay. I loved my experienced here but, i know many friends who thought it was okay.
Our waiter gave us a little tip after bringing us the bill, If they're full, you can always come by and sit at the bar without reservations. You will be able to order food a la carte and dessert which was great to know for the future. After picking up the bill our waiter also asked us if we need validation, if we used their valet or if he could call a cab for us which was great for them to offer!"

Being lucky enough to have experienced Jean Georges in NYC's Trump tower,  Oringer's Clio in the Elliot Boston (closed forever),   Lee's Susur in Kings West Toronto (closed forever) - one realizes how precious an establishment like Gary Danko really is.
Excellent food aside, the incredible ambience of the venue together with the 2 to 3 hours of VIP prince/princesses treatment by the entire crew - down to the very minute details of the evening - makes every Gary Danko visit a total pleasure.
We definitely do not belong to the book-ahead, and dress-well-for-dinner genre; and despite the last minute booking and being subpar under-dressed: Gary's crew made sure we felt superbly comfortable and valued throughout the evening - right from the moment we entered the door, the impeccably dressed Maître D  Steven welcomed us, waiter Andrew was tending to our every need during the evening, up until we left walking past the valet to hail our Uber.
Being from a first generation immigrant family, dining value is important and still very much in our blood.  It is amazing that Danko's menu (together with some of the other best-in-business operations like Jean Georges' and Oringer's) had been design to cater to even this slient niche foodie minority.  Making us feel great!  Being able to feast on finely plated and gourmet prepped/assembled Seared Foie Gras, Roasted Lobster, Seared Sea Bass, and
Lemon
Pepper
Duck
Breast
for around $26 each sooths the frugal soul - beats slumming in Chinatown for the same stuff by distant miles.
The well-paced delivery, presentation of each dish, together with various 'complements of the chef' offerings throughout the evening, justifies the smaller tasting sized portions, ensuring our palate is never numbed enough (from being full) not to taste the fine ingredient and preparation of each dish.   The 'desert after desert' and the 'take home cake' were some of the final touches that sealed this Gary Danko experience as among the finest dining experiences in our lives.
Thanks to the dedication of Gary and his crew for keeping this class dining act in-play, for almost two decades.  It is not an easy task anywhere, not to mention operating smack center in the tourist zone in one of the most expensive cities in the world to run a restaurant.
Danko is a gift to San Francisco.  Treasure it while it lasts."

I feel like on any other given night, I would've given 4 stars. My boyfriend and I were seated promptly as soon as we got into Gary danko. While my water was being filled, I got a slight splash of water on my dress. I brushed it off thinking eh one small thing like this doesn't mean this place has bad service. We ordered our drinks before we ordered our food. My boyfriend got a blanton and I wasn't sure if I wanted a sweeter wine but I did say one of the sweeter wines sounded good. The wait staff told me I could try it and if I liked it I could get it by the glass. The Blanton was served first since they had to get the wine from the cellar. It was served in a chipped glass. I cannot fathom how someone can serve anything in a chipped glass in this type of establishment. We told the wait staff and they told us they would get us a new glass. We waited through our appetizers and entrees before my boyfriend finally flagged someone down to check up on his drink. When my wine arrived, he had my try a sip. I was not impressed by it so I asked for a Pinot noir suggestion on the more fruit forward side. This guy had the audacity to make a snide comment of ""well you should've just stuck with Pinot"". Well what if I wanted to try something different? What a repulsive attitude this guy had all night. Must have been a bad day but I still tried to be polite with this guy.
Anyways, the food is the most important part. This is the sole reason I am here. The seafood risotto was extremely creamy and light. Delicate pieces of seafood just complimented the risotto. This is a must get here!
The glazed oysters with osetra caviar is also a must get. The oysters were plump and was sweet while the caviar was light and salty which gave a good pop to the overall texture and taste. For this dish, it is an acquired taste. My boyfriend doesn't like the taste of the sea.
Thai coconut with seafood. Those plump chunks of scallops were tender and not sandy which is the downfall of most places. Thai coconut curry is light so it doesn't over power the flavors of the seafood.

I celebrated my boyfriend's birthday here while we were visiting San Francisco, and we were fortunate enough to be seated in a private booth for just us two! Each table has red roses on it too, which made it quite romantic!
Service was beyond impeccable. There were multiple individuals servicing our table, which made the dinner go very smoothly. They cleared our tables quickly, checked in on us multiple times, served us without any lag time, and refilled our waters without having to ask.
I got the 4-course menu ($106), and my boyfriend got the 5-course menu ($124). They served us each our plates, but we just shared our meals family style.
(0) Thai Soup Amuse Bouche with Lobster
It was very hearty, light, and flavorful. I wish they would have listed this as part of their menu because it was amazing, even better than some of their menu items.
(1) Risotto with Rock Shrimp, Dungeness Crab, Spring Vegetables, and Beech Mushrooms
Most risottos are unbearably heavy and rich, but this was not. It actually reminded me of a thicker congee, so it was comforting to eat. They were also very generous with the shrimp and crab, which I really appreciated.
(2) Glazed Oysters with Osetra Caviar, White Asparagus, Leeks, and Lettuce Cream
This was the perfect appetizer! The oysters were like little clouds in my mouth because it was just so fluffy and light. But if you're generally not a fan of oysters, I would not recommend it though because it does have a slight ""seafoody"" taste.
(3) Roast Maine Lobster with Potato Purée, Morel Mushrooms, Edamame, and Tarragon
The lobster was perfectly cooked, and the potato purée was a very flavorful ""mashed potato."" I loved the broth that came with the plate! Portion wise, this is a quite small plate, so just be aware if you're choosing this as an entree.
(4) Coconut Thai Curry with Shrimp, Calamari, Lobster, Scallops, Candied Peanuts, and Shiitake Mushrooms
OMG. This is a MUST ORDER plate. It was the best dish of the night! You are initially served a plate of white rice, and one of the servers then  places the seafood around the rice and then pours the coconut Thai curry over the rice and seafood. The flavor is so amazing that I honestly wanted another plate or even two! It's just so light and comforting. All the seafood was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth.
(5) Pan Seared Scallops with English Pea-Mint Purée, Asparagus, Fava Beans, and Beech Mushrooms
Scallops were so perfectly cooked! The description also says fava beans, but I think I had lentils with mine. Overall, really solid dish.
(6) Soft Shell Crab with Pancetta, Roasted Eggplant, Cucumber and Thai Lime Dressing
This was more like two separate dishes placed onto one plate. The soft shell crab was extremely flavorful, and the herb salad on the side was very refreshing. It reminded me of the inside of a Vietnamese spring roll. Portion wise, this is also a small plate, so just be aware.
(7) Roasted Quail Stuffed with Mushroom Ragout, Leeks, Quinoa, and Foie Gras with Baby Artichokes and Green Garlic
It doesn't say in the description, but it's served with a mini corn bread cake, which I loved! The quail was super adorable and petite. I thought it was pretty great but nothing too special. The quail drumsticks were probably the highlight of this dish.
(8)
Lemon
Pepper
Duck
Breast
with
Duck
Hash, Bacon Braised Endive, and Port Glazed Cherries
That
duck
breast
was the definition of perfection. It was so well cooked and delicious. If you're not used to gamey meats, then beware that it is a tad more chewy than beef. As for the
duck
hash and all the sides, I could care less for them. Those were just okay.
(9) Trio Creme Brûlée with Assorted Cookies
There are 3 creme brûlée: Vanilla Bean, Brandy, and Blueberry Lemongrass. The vanilla is the classic one, and I just thought it was so yummy. The brandy one is a bit too rich and heavy, so I didn't really enjoy it. The blueberry lemongrass one was a beautiful dark purple color, and it was tart in flavor. The assorted cookies were just okay.
(Extra) Complimentary Assorted Dessert Plate
We received 8 bite-sized desserts that were all different in flavor. There was only one that I didn't enjoy, which was the red jelly one. Otherwise, I would recommend trying all of them because they were delicious.
(Extra) Complimentary Birthday Chocolate Mousse Cake
This was very sweet of them to bring out for my boyfriend's birthday. If you truly love the flavor of chocolate, then this is the dessert for you. It is not like the grocery market chocolate. It has a more rich, bitter chocolate flavor to it that is amazing on the palate.

We were in our very early 20s and working our minimum wage jobs, wishing that one day we could eat here. Fast forward to present time, my husband surprised me for my 30th birthday and booked a table here.
We had a 9:30pm reservation and from the beginning to end, the service was spectacular. We arrived 10 mins early and were seated right away. They sat us next to each other against the wall in view of everybody. As our host said, ""Great seats for people watching.""
My husband and I chose the 4 course meal and I love how you're not limited to each section of the menu. There were many options and we wanted to try as much as we could, so we both got different things. We each ordered an appetizer, seafood and 2 meat dishes. The food was soooo good. A lot of the things we ordered were things we both were trying for the first time.
We ordered the risotto, seared foie gras, seared scallops,
roast
maine
lobster
, juniper crusted bison, filet of beef, stuffed quail and lemon pepper duck breast. Although they were all delicious, the highlights of the meal were the risotto, seared foie gras, duck breast and bison. The dishes were timed and spaced out perfectly throughout the evening. We didn't feel like we had to wait too long in between entrees, nor did we feel rushed. At the end of our meal, they gave us a small tray of mini desserts and a complementary birthday dessert. They also gave us a pumpkin cream cheese muffin to take home, which was a nice touch.
Overall, my husband and I had a great time and both agreed that this was our favorite dining (and fanciest) experiences to date. It was a great way to celebrate my birthday! We left the restaurant at almost midnight. Those 2 hours flew by and we didn't even realize it because we were having such a great time. No phones, just quality time, good food and good conversation. We will definitely be back."

Don't hesitate. Book the reservation. It's the most bang for your buck Michelin star experience you'll get. The service is amazing and the food is even better. Do it. And then read reviews to figure out what dishes you want.
Seriously, one of my favorite dining experiences EVER. Worth every penny you spend here (and more!!!)
We came here for our joint 30th birthdays. After much thought, we decided that GD has been one of our top 5 dining experiences and that there was no better place to spend our birthdays.
We each ordered the 5 course dinner.
Salt Cured Foie Gras Torchon with Peach Compote (his) - The lesser of the two foie dishes, but still delicious. I wish there was more bread for the foie, but that is our only gripe with this dish.
Seared Foie Gras with Caramelized Onions & Black Mission Figs (mine) - oh my God. Get this. The onions, foie, and figs pair perfectly for an explosion in your mouth. 10/10 would get again.
Roasted
Sea Scallops (mine) - I got this dish last time, and got it again this time. It never disappoints and is always delicious. The cook on the scallop is perfect and it's tender and juicy.
Roast
Maine
Lobster
(his) - If I wasn't mildly allergic to
lobster
, this would have been my dish. The components of this dish really seal the deal. The
lobster
was cooked well and not gummy.
Seared Filet (his) - Probably our least favorite dish of the evening, but even then, it's something we enjoyed. The cook (medium rare) was great and the basil butter - excellent.
Pan Seared Bass (mine) - I ordered this even though I'm not a fan of bell peppers OR capers...but seriously, I am so impressed. I cleared my plate and finished it ALL. Impressive especially if you know me and know that I will pick the tiniest piece of bell pepper out of ANY dish.
Lemon Pepper Duck Breast (mine) - I will admit that by this course, I was feeling fully stuffed and needed to save room for dessert. So I took a taste and asked them to box it up for me. Even as my lunch the next day...it was delicious. Best lunch EVER. Note: GD's duck has been my favorite dish out of any duck dish I've had...even internationally. Don't miss out.
Trio of Creme Brulee (mine) - My favorite dessert is creme brulee. If it's on the menu, I'll get it. THREE of them? Sold. The flavors this time were vanilla, bourbon, and ginger. The vanilla was wonderful - can't ever go wrong with the OG. The bourbon was to DIE for. It tasted like caramel and flan - it was just the right amount of gooey and melt in your mouth. It was super sweet though. The ginger one was the only one that was slightly disappointing. It had a little too much bite and was overpowering.
I love the take home cake they send you with. They used to only give it to the women in the dining party, but this time they gave us TWO!!!! Mmmm mmm mm pineapple cake for breakfast the next morning. Not gonna lie, the take home cake plays a HUGE role in my decision to come back to GD.
Service is impeccable - but that's exactly what you should expect from somewhere as old school as GD. The last time we came, I was in a soft cast for my foot and they were super accommodating with my temporary handicap.
This time, one of our entrees took a little longer than they expected. We didn't mind since we understand that Saturday nights are busy. But they comped a glass for wine for me and a glass of fancy Merlot grape juice for my boyfriend.
I can't wait to come back here again - it's still one of my (our) favorite dining experiences/meals. Goal: try every menu item and every cheese on the cheese cart."

It has been on my list of places to try for ten years. It doesn't look like the menu has changed much either as it stays true to classic French technique. We came to celebrate mother's day with my family and while there were some highs and lows, I'm glad I finally got to try it.
The menu concept is interesting as you can choose between 3-, 4-, and 5-course tasting menus. The interesting part is that you could choose whatever you want, including all appetizers, all desserts, or even all
main
entrees. One of the low points was our experience with the sommelier, who seemed to look down on us when we ordered a half bottle of wine between three people (we don't drink much). Although his eventual recommended wine was good, we didn't appreciate his judgmental attitude.
As for the food, we started with appetizers including the risotto with rock shrimp, Dungeness crab, asparagus, and beech mushrooms. While the risotto was good, the flavors were very one-note, but loved the shrimp and crab. The salt cured foie gras torchon with Meyer lemon jam, charred baby leeks, smoked almonds and country bread was my favorite. The foie gras was so rich and creamy, and was the perfect complement to the toast. For
mains
, the
roast
Maine
lobster
is a signature dish that is a must-try. It's both elegant and a classic. For my last entree, I tried the juniper crusted bison, which surprisingly wasn't gamey at all. I also tried a taste of the seared filet of beef, which was cooked perfectly. The
roasted
quail stuffed with mushrooms was also a great dish.
We skipped the cheese course and tried a couple desserts including the trio of creme brulee with assorted cookies, and the recommended warm Louisiana butter cake. As with many fine dining restaurants, I wasn't as impressed by the dessert. The butter cake wasn't as moist as the one I've had at Maestro's and the creme brulee, while good, didn't have my favorite flavors.
The night ended with us receiving a pineapple cheesecake for the next day and a rose for the women for mother's day, which was a nice touch. The ambiance was romantic enough for a nice date, but also fits for family gatherings. With so many consistent years of food and service, it's no wonder it has retained its one star Michelin."

Overall experience for this visit would be 3.5 stars, but I'll round up to 4 until I return for another experience.
Came here with my family to celebrate my mom's birthday. We arrived separately; my family arrived ~15 mins before scheduled time (they got sited right away, which was nice), I arrived ~5 mins late to the reservation.
When I arrived to the restaurant, there was no one at the entrance to greet me, I had to look around the room for my family and walk myself to the table.
After I've sat down, we waited at least 15~20 mins before our waiter checked-in with us and started explaining the menu. I understand that they were waiting for everyone to be here before talking about the menu, but I'm shocked that they waited almost 20 mins before they stopped by. (Maybe they didn't notice that I have arrived? or forgot that we have yet to order?)
Our waiter was very nice once we started interacting with him, he gave recommendations throughout the ordering process and checked-in with us a couple times throughout the meal. However the waitress who was refilling water and bread might have a wrong understanding of ""good service"". She was doing everything super fast; pouring water way too fast (splashing water everywhere), putting (or more like throwing) bread down on your plate. Fast service is part of good service, but not all of it; I was constantly distracted/surprised by her quick movement around the table and was concerned that she would splash water on my food or on me. The sommelier who came to help us was even worse. He was rude and had an attitude that he didn't want to help us (maybe because of the price of the bottle we were looking at?) He told us he will look in the cellar for a recommendation, but didn't return until 15 mins later; during that time we saw that he was pouring wine for other tables, we actually thought that he decided to ignore us because we were ordering a cheap bottle.
I will give it to them that our wine glass, water glass, and bread plate were never empty throughout.
The ambiance wasn't that great either. Table arrangements are pretty crowed (waiters have to squeeze sideways between my chair and the person sitting behind me to get through) and background noise is pretty loud (to the point where I have to lean in for the person across me to hear me), not what I expected from a fine dinning restaurant with a Michelin star. There are many restaurants that serve the same quality food, and have better service and ambiance.
The food in general were pretty good, here's a quick rating for the food I order/ try.

SERVICE-
Great service, very proper, well dressed, we were taken care of the whole night. However, halfway through the the dinner, we had two men get seated next to us on the the left. Tables are tight quarters already and they must be regulars as members of the staff came out to talk to them quite a bit. Many times, I had a member of the staff squeezed so tight up next to my table with his back turned to speak these guys. I felt uncomfortable as they are loud and our sense our special dinner was sort of taken away.
Would I come back again? I'm willing to give them another try. Was I full off of the
main
courses? No-I had 2 small scallops and 2 small
lobster
tails. Boyfriend had the beef and we shared the cake. I was filled up off of the butter cake, dessert platter and chocolate birthday cake. Alot of sweets as fillers but was not full off of the actual courses. Would recommend for special occasions, for the ambiance and delicious food."

On the San Fran streets is now where I spend most of my days
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
Rollin in my whip sometimes Uber Pool
When a couple of Yelpers who were up to no good
Started flaggin my reviews in ma neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my wifey got scared
I said 'Relax honey I'm taking ya to Gary Danko to hobnob with da folks from Bel Air'
...........
What to order at Gary Danko for a first timer? I agonized over this and spent much more time than I should of thinking about this.
I like lists/rankings (as those of you who follow me know) ...since they make decisions easier for me...so I turned this decision making process into the Research Project I dubbed  ""Gary Danko number of times someone indicated this was their favorite dish"" game.
I did a very very (did I say very) un-scientific ranking based on going over a ton of Yelp reviews of friends/well written reviews. I didn't do a spreadsheet but I tried to list them based on how frequent I felt they were mentioned. Typically I do this rough calculcation/analysis in my head but I wanted to get it down on paper because there were so many darn dishes to choose from.
Rank below is based on the # of instances I believed people mentioned the dish as their favorite dish. Risotto seemed to be winner...on down.
1)Risotto 2) Pan Seared Scallops 3)
Roasted
Quail 4)Lemon Pepper Duck Breast 5)
Roast
Maine
Lobster
6)Coconut Thai Curry 7) Foie Gras
8)Cheese Plate 9)
Roasted
Pork Tenderloin and Belly 9) Loin of Lamb
10)Sea Bass
So knowing that and knowing I had a hot date (my wife). I went with the decision making process below. This would achieve my primary goal of getting to try as many dishes as possible.
Step 1  (Create List Ranking)  above
Step 2: I then asked the wifey to let me know what she was ordering. Key step ...happy wife = happy life.
Step 3 : She listed Risotto, Seared Beef, Dungeness Crab Salad
Step 4:  I requested that she bump up 5 courses so we could taste more things. It helped that I was treating : o P
Step 5: So basically I eliminated  Risotto from my rankings. She also picked two dishes that were not on my list (Seared Beef and Dungeness Crab Salad) darn! But hey see above..happy wife= happy life.
Step 6: We still had 7 courses to play with so we went straight down the list . I added Sea Bass only b/c I love Seabass.
So after that initial selection here is how I felt the dishes were (re-ranked for your viewing pleasure) from fave  to least fave. I also put in parentheses what I perceived to be their rank before dinner.
Rod's Gary Danko Dish Rankings:
#1 Fave--Pan Seared Scallops (2)-- so soft and tasty great sauce  Cannellini Bean Puree.  Best scallops I've had
2-- Foie Gras (7) --Soft like butter Carmelized Onions and Apples bring a great dynamic.
3--Pan Seared Sea Bass (11) - The Clam Succotash  , sweet potato puree  and shallots the seabass sits on top of were also super tasty.
4-- Coconut Thai Curry (6) - Nice Presentation. The waitress bring  sauce in a mini pot and pours the sauce over the Candied Peanuts and Shitake Mushrooms. The Curry sauce is a seafood medley of Shrimp, Calamari,
Lobster
and Scallops that taste delicious
5-- Risotto (1)Everything goes well together and almost tastes like a fancier Filipino Dish Arroz Caldo. This where my ""must order for next time line is""
..................
6--
Roasted
Quail (3) - This is more about the things that are stuffed ( Mushroom Ragout, Leeks, quinoa and Foie Gras with Fingerling Potatoes and Porcini Cream) than it is about the actual Quail. I mean this was good but not amazing to me.
7-- Dungeness Crab Salad ( NR) Another nice presentation and taste combo with Melons, Cucumbers,
Roasted
Eggplant and Thai Mango dressing. Wifey insisted that she had a ""light salad"" so that's how this made it as a selection. Once again see above...happy wife= happy life.
8--
Roast
Maine
Lobster
(5) - good ,savory but clearly behind scallops n sea bass in my eyes in the ""seafood category""
9-- Lemon Pepper Duck Breast(4)  Bacon Braised Endive and Cardamom Poached pears were an interesting combo. I thought the dish was decent but not very flavorful as other dishes and would not order again.
#10 least fave but still o.k.-- Seared Beef (NR) last  Gnocchi was tasty and the Swiss Char and Stilton Butter are nice touches but just was not a fan of this dish. Would not order again
....................................
After Dinner:
I requested a Lyft  and when it came near
The license plate said 'Fresh' and it had dice in the mirror
After five courses you may have thought this night was done
But I thought ""Nah, forget it, yo holmes, to San Tung!"""

(Maybe I was expecting too much out of Gary Danko?) I wanted to love my experience at GD, but let me put it this way: if you've never been to GD and you think that perhaps you're missing out--well hun, you're not. But a once in a while visit would be luxurious enough.
OK LET'S TALK FOOD
For starters, they provided us with yellow beets for amuse bouche, and I'd say, I'll order this by itself as an appetizer if only it was on the menu! It was so good!
I had the 5-course menu consisting of the following:
1) Cured Foie Gras Torchon with
Roasted
Grapes, Candied Peanuts, & Honey Tuille
- This is below the best foie gras I've ever tasted! The perfect foie gras torchon is supposed to kinda melt on your tongue like a creamy butter. Ths one was served cold as it should be. Yes, foie gras torchon is the kind of thing that's gotta be served as cold as possible, but then when you do serve it, you gotta provide a warm knife. That way the foie gras kinda melts in the mouth. You know what I mean? Well, they did the former but not the latter. (Again, like I said, perhaps I was expecting too much.)
-------------------------------
2) Seared Ahi Tuna with Avocado, Nori, Enoki Mushrooms and Lemon Soy Dressing
- Came with 4 slices aesthetically placed to look like a tuna butterfly (cute!), the two bigger portions had a rich bright red color, which was the most desirable. The two smaller ones (patched with the nori) had a brownish color when I flipped it. The taste wasn't the freshest. I traded this one with my friend's plate and I ate his pan-seared bass plate instead.
-------------------------------
3) Pan Seared Bass with Israeli Couscous, Broccoli, Glazed Turnips, and Radish (5/5)
- Oh, my goodness, thank you for this saving grace! The pan seared bass was cooked to perfection, and the couscous is probably the best version I've ever tasted of it. Mixed together, they were exploding with tastiness and flavor, I was wowed.
-------------------------------
4)
Roast
Maine
Lobster
with Potato Puree, Black Trumpet Mushrooms, Edamame and Tarragon
- Small
lobster
portion enough to fill my tiny body. The
lobster
was tender cooked saturated with tasty potato puree. It was good.
-------------------------------
5) Grand Marnier Souffle with Creamsicle Ice Cream and Two Sauces (raspberry and something else)
- a really pale version of souffle that spent time in the oven just the right amount of time. It was not too airy, nice texture, deftly sweetened... I ate it all by myself! Heh.
-------------------------------
NOW LET'S TALK SERVICE
- They offer coat check-ins and valet service.
- They didn't ask for my ID when I ordered wine--I'm impressed. Other restaurants are fooled by my Asian genes. GD staff didn't bother.
- They serve complimentary bread, which was quite boring frankly, it was a waste of time -_-
- They give you a little cake if you made your reservation and told them it was for a celebration. It was my best friend's birthday, so I got to blow the cake candle for him. Haha.
- Their bathroom looks elegant, like, why is there a chair beside the toilet seat?? There are reasons to this of course.
- Our server(s) weren't really personable, they were like in ""all-business mode"" and that wasn't very friendly or welcoming.
- They give you little takeaway desserts (pastries) wrapped in a golden package so that you'll remember them even when you get home. Kind of like, to reinforce the unforgettable dining experience you had last night."

Pretty difficult to find parking as you can expect. It was super cold that evening and we were lucky enough to snag a parking spot only a block and a half away. They offer valet service for $20 if you aren't lucky with parking.
The restaurant's exterior wasn't what I had imagined for some reason. You couldn't see anything in the restaurant as all the windows were tinted black. We were in for a surprise, but a wonderful one. It was very elegant inside. We came a few minutes past our reservation time as we made a quick pit stop to Patagonia a block away. Our reservation time was 5:30 which was when they opened. I was surprised to see so many people sitting down already. That was fast.
You have the option of choosing the tasting menu or a 3-4-5 course meal. We went for the 4-course meal. What I loved about this option was that even though you were given the option of appetizers, seafood, meats, and desserts, you could choose four of ANYTHING. It doesn't necessarily have to go in what you'd think as the proper sequence (appetizer, entree, dessert), although you could do it that way if you wanted to. It could be four entrees... all
lobster
if you wanted! I skipped out on the appetizers and went straight to the entrees, heh.
Originally I had ordered four entrees, BUT when I got to my third course, I started getting a bit full. Luckily, they were still able to change my fourth course into a dessert rather than the seared filet of beef I had ordered. The waiter recommended getting a dessert when I was placing my initial order as my fourth course since it was my first time, but I definitely overestimated my appetite and turned down the dessert option. He knew all along, ha. Anyways - what I had ordered was the
roast
maine
lobster
, seared sea scallops, lemon pepper duck breast, and the chocolate souffle with two sauces. I think my top two favorites were the scallops and the duck breast. Both were so tender. Although the
lobster
was good (such a drastic change from the horrible overcooked
lobster
I had at that buffet in Reno omg),
lobster
never seems to wow me just because I've never been a huge fan of it. My boyfriend order the
roast
maine
lobster
, coconut thai curry with an assortment of seafood, herb crusted loin of lamb, and the duck breast as well. His coconut thai curry tasted more like a bisque than it did curry, but was still very good. I definitely wouldn't have ordered dessert as my fourth course if I knew we were going to be served an assortment of tiny desserts along with the free birthday dessert for my boyfriend.
At the end of our meal, we were given these nicely packaged desserts to take home with us. They were banana cream cheese cakes I believe!
Honestly, I would have been content with a 3-course meal.. it was too much food for one night! I guess it really depends on what you order and how hungry you really are.
Food was great, definitely super filling if you order the right things. Service was top notch. That's the one thing that stood out the most for me. Water was refilled almost instantly. And so was the bread. I found it kind of funny that my bread was refilled within a second of grabbing my final piece. They were so on top of everything, I loved it!
Definitely a great place to celebrate a special occasion!"

It still remains my favorite 1 Michelin Star restaurant, but I thought that this time was a little less of an incredible/amazing/out-of-this-world experience than when I was here last November. There were no missteps that I can point to, but for some reason I didn't feel like the service was quite as on point as previously (although it was still very, very attentive), and the portion sizes were a bit smaller. Our group of 3 ordered 3 courses each ($89; 4 courses is $109 and 5 courses is $128; you can order any combination of appetizers, entrees, or desserts). We got the following:
Appetizers:
Seared Foie Gras with Caramelized Onions and Apples: 5/5. The foie gras is so buttery, rich, and succulent. My only disappointment is that it was about 1/3 of the size of the foie gras that we had here in November. Maybe with rising prices the portion size got smaller?
Poached Farm Egg ""Carbonara"" with Braised Bacon and Brioche: 3/5. Probably my least favorite dish of the night. It was fairly small and while the egg was creamy and cooked perfectly, I didn't think that it had any very special twist to it that made it stand out.
Seafood:
Roast
Maine
Lobster
with Potato Purée, Blood Orange, Edamame and Basil: 4/5 the
lobster
was very tender and went well with the puree. Beautifully presented.
Seared Sea Scallops with Lentils,
Roasted
Peppers, Potatoes, Parsley and Madras Curry Vinaigrette: 5/5. The scallops were so tender and full of flavor. One of my favorite dishes.
Meat:
Seared Filet of Beef with Potato Gnocchi, Olive Oil, Swiss Chard and Stilton Butter: 4/5. A word of warning that the butter has blue cheese on it, and so has quite a tangy taste to it. The filet is cooked medium rare and is very tender.
Roasted
Quail Stuffed with Mushrooms, Truffled Corn Bread and Foie Gras with Pumpkin Orzo and Glazed Apples: 5/5. one of my favorite dishes. The skin was deliciously crispy, the meat juicy, and the stuffing had a variety of flavors.
Lemon Pepper Duck Breast with Duck Hash, Celeriac-Garlic Purée, Belgian Endive and Cardamom Poached Pears: 5/5. One of my other favorite dishes. I just love duck, and the duck hash was excellent as well!
Herb Crusted Loin of Lamb with Farrotto, Medjool Dates, Rainbow Carrots and Green Chermoula: 4/5. The meat had an interesting flavor. It had a little bit of gaminess, but not too much.
Dessert:
Chilled Peanut Butter Bar with Dark Chocolate Ganache, Feuilletine and Pretzel Ice Cream: 5/5. Excellent! Very salty, but that was refreshing against the sweetness and richness of the chocolate.
They also brought out a complimentary amouse bouche, a complimentary birthday dessert, a complimentary set of assorted mini-desserts, and a complimentary pineapple banana cake for each person to take home. Overall, a great restaurant to go to for special occasions!"

I booked my reservation two months in advance just to get the desirable date n time that I wanted. The host called three days early just to confirm it with me. I also requested to sit in the
main
dining room because I thought the second room was a lil too crowded and the decoration isn't as nice as the
main
dining room. We reserved it for two people at 6:30pm. Lots of street meter parking but it's free after 7. We were greeted and seated right away from the host. My boyfriend and I decided to get the five course meal. There is also complimentary bread n butter in the beginning. I ordered seared ahi tuna,
roast
Maine
lobster
, lamb, duck breast, and lastly cheesecake for dessert. Everything was spectacular and delicious. I really don't have any complaints at all. They were that amazing from the food to the service.

The menu was super flexible and let you choose 3-5 courses depending on how many dishes you wanted to try. You could even choose 5 entrees if you wanted (though of course not recommended). The service was impeccable and the waiters are all very knowledgeable about all the dishes. They aimed to make sure you left very well-fed and satisfied. When I was unsure of whether or not to get a certain drink, they even let me sample it before deciding (I didn't even ask to sample it, but very much appreciated that they allowed me to do so. They even threw in a free amuse bouche in the beginning, a parcel of pineapple cake to take home, and a tray of assorted desserts at the end. I came with a friend and we each chose to do a 5 course meal (totaling 10 different dishes to try). I loved each and every one of them, but of those, I highly recommend the following: seared foie gras (my friend thought this was even better than the foie gras we had in paris), glazed oysters,
roast

Nothing special. There is no bang for the buck in the food. Don't eat the birthday cake. I think Minny (The Help) made it with her ""special ingredient.""
I did some research for our vacation and people recommended to reserve restaurants only a week in advance. Bad idea. All the top choices were completely booked and this was the only place still taking reservations. (No surprise)
I had requested we get a table where we can sit next to each other during the confirmation call. Instead they still seated us at a table where we were sitting across from each other, and I had to talk to 3 different people before they changed our table (2 of which never came back and 1 of those 2 people actually ignored me when I tried to get their attention [I made eye contact and I signaled]).
Bread:
The first round of bread was so stale it actually *clanked* when dropped (not placed) on my plate. Second round of bread was ok, but my appetite was already completely destroyed by the horrible bread before.
Appetizers:
-Poached Farm Egg
Honestly this was pretty good. It is one of the few reasons it is getting a 2 stars. I recommend the Poached Egg if you decide to come here against my recommendation. Perfectly cooked. Simple yet rich taste.
-Seared Foie Gras with Caramelized Onions
I usually like Foie Gras, but this was horrible. The best part of this dish was the caramelized onions. Foie Gras was not seared, but burned where one side was actually crispy. I was told it ""should be like that."" No. NO. NO! I know what a forced fed duck liver's texture and taste is suppose to be like.
Seafood:
-
Roast
Maine
Lobster
The
lobster
was better than what I was expecting after having tasted all the other courses before it. The
lobster
was fresh and well seasoned. The flavors worked together harmoniously. I would recommend it. Taking into consideration the
lobsters
were from
Maine
, it was quite good.
-Seared Scallops
The Pea-Mint Puree complimented the Scallops exceptionally well. Well made. Do I think it could have been better? Yes. Was it satisfactory? Yes. It was good but not great. I would say that a 2nd or 3rd year culinary student with a bright future made this. Any place with 4 $ on yelp, I expect nothing short of greatness not something that is a work in progress.
Meat:
-Lamb
-Bison
They were both pretty bad. The quality of meat was just terrible. You can tell the chef did the best he could with the ingredients he has, but boy was the meat bad. They gave a plentiful amount of sauce to cover up the bad meat, but you cannot hide a bad foundation.
Cheese:
Raisin bread with cheese? Really? The cheese on the cart was bad. We got a recommendation of the most popular cheese and they were all terrible. There was obvious signs that the cheese has been aerated for quiet some time before they were served. The discoloration was bad. With low lighting and wine, it feels like they think you won't notice the difference. Are those grapes from Safeway? Taste like it.
Desserts:
DO NOT EAT THE BIRTHDAY CAKE. Tastes horrible. Doesn't even taste like chocolate. It reminds me of the day when I get a case of the runs and the smell of your own fecal matter makes you want to vomit. That smell is what the taste is like. I actually vomited a little into the napkin. I took it to go and threw it out once I got out of the door. I wouldn't even give it to a homeless person.
Strawberry Souffle
The best part was the Strawberry sorbet. Rich strawberry sorbet. Everything else was trash. I normally like anything strawberry but this was so bad I felt sorry for the strawberries. It looks good when they pour the sauces in. It tastes completely and utterly disappointing. It tasted like trash and went directly in the trash.
Flambe
It was decent. The guy making it did not seem to know what he was doing and was actually shaking quite a bit. The pieces of pineapple were extremely sour. At least use ripe fruits. The sauce was good, but it was only made up of 3 ingredients: Sugar, Butter, and Alcohol. Also other servers were constantly brushing past him, it was somewhat annoying. Let the man make my dessert undisturbed!
P.S. Also most servers are wearing over-sized suits. If I wanted to see people with baggy shirts and pants, I would just go back to high school. At least look presentable."

Upon arriving, we were seated promptly at a table side-by-side. It was obvious that the space of the restaurant is small, and this was their modish attempt to save some room. It was totally fine though because I love dining *next* to my boyfriend just as much as across from him :p
A wait staff came over straightaway with a wine menu for us to look over. Although the wine menu was super extensive, it was well organized and easy for me to pick one fairly quickly. Another wait staff came by to offer us the current food menu and explained quickly the ""rules"" which is that there aren't really any -- you can pick and choose from any section for your 3, 4, or 5-course meals and they adjust the portions accordingly. We opted to get a 4 course meal each, one from each of the sections anyway and it was plenty filling for both of us. After everything was ordered, another wait staff came by with the half bottle of wine that I had ordered and allowed me to try some first before I got ""stuck"" with it. In general, I knew that I liked Cabs and red blends so I knew the blend that I picked wouldn't do me any injustice -- one small taste later and both our wine glasses were appropriately filled with delicious red wine.
The wait staff rotated constantly so we weren't able to ""bond"" with one, but that's OK too because maybe they figured out how to be the most efficient in a small space -- everyone was extremely attentive and professional, and knowledgeable of both the food menu and wine menu and despite our indecisiveness, we were quickly able to choose quickly with a bit of their help. Our food came out quickly and our plates were cleaned off and reset based on the dish we selected.
* * * Appetizers * * *
// Risotto with Rock Shrimp, Dungeness Crab, Summer Squash
This was so yummy, I love seafood and so shrimp/dungeness crab risotto was the obvious choice for me for the first course. My boyfriend took a small bite and enjoyed it as well. Funnily, even though he's extremely allergic to shrimp, this was the dish he craved the next day.
// Seared Foie Gras with Caramelized Onions and Cherries
Actually my first time that I tried foie gras -- This was a small but appropriately portioned, juicy, fatty, melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness. Definitely one of those things you indulge in once in awhile to spoil yourself. Must-try if you've never tried foie gras!!
* * * Fish and Seafood * * *
//
Roast
Maine
Lobster
More seafood, my 2nd course pick. The
lobster
was so fresh, so tender. This set the new standard for all things seafood for me... The texture was absolutely perfect, but unfortunately the meaty part was probably only the size of my finger. Until next time..
//Horseradish Crusted Salmon Medallion with Dilled Cucumbers and Mustard Sauce
Hm, I generally really enjoy Salmon, unfortunately (or fortunately) everything else was so exquisite that the salmon was largely overshadowed and I don't recall it being super out-of-this world. Perhaps sea bass would have been the better choice here.
* * * Meat and Game Birds * * *
//Juniper Crusted Bison with King Trumpet Mushrooms
Mmm bison. Another first for me... Actually I may have tried this in an exotic sausage or something (heh..heh) This was cooked to perfection, rare and juicy on the inside, cooked and seasoned intensely flavorful on the outside. This was also a win for me.
//Lemon Pepper Duck Breast with Duck Hash, Bacon Braised Endive and Port Glazed Cherries
I don't usually go for duck. I'm perfectly happy with chicken, but this... was pretty much life-changing. They sliced the mound of duck breast thinly but each thin slice still managed to retain its flavors. I was honestly pretty surprised how much I liked this! Good recommendation from our waiter to get this over the pork!
* * * Desserts * * *
//Trio of Crème Brûlée with Assorted Cookies
Who doesn't love crème brûlée?? And it comes with 3 different types..? Sold!
//Lemon Soufflé Cake with Crème Fraîche Panna Cotta and Raspberry Sorbet
The tartness of the lemon helped balance out the sweetness of this one, however it was still a tad sweeter than I would have preferred. Ending up taking this home and had it the next afternoon anyway because this was still heavenly to these taste buds.
Dessert-wise... My *complimentary* birthday chocolate mousse was surprisingly my favorite here, and I'm not even normally a chocolate-loving person (too sweet 90% of the time). However, their rendition of a chocolate cake/mousse seems to have been made with a flawless blend of rich dark chocolate and other ingredients that I became unreservedly in love with its divine taste. As if the complimentary birthday cake wasn't enough, they also brought us a small platter of assorted cookies (petit fleurs), AND gave us each a pineapple breakfast muffin to have the next morning!! From service to ambiance to the food selection and quality, everything was A+++."

We made reservations 3 weeks in advance where the staff informed us what available dates and times they had and they even called us a day before our reservation as a friendly reminder. If you're worried about parking, don't be. There are plenty of options around the area with their own valet parking for $20, a parking garage up the block, or metered street parking good for up to 4 hours until 7pm. we were lucky to have found metered parking down the block in a heavy traffic area.
Upon arrival we3 were greeted by the host and seated promptly. Our waiter asked if we've dine at Gary Danko before and we replied that we have not and he kindly went through all of our options and answered every questions we had. You basically choose your preferred amount of courses and pick any item on the menu. If you chose a 3 course you can grab 3 desserts or 3 entrees etc you're not limited to getting 1 appetizer, 1 entree and 1 dessert you can choose whatever you like. Our waiter also stated that they don't recommend all meat/poultry dishes for your courses but, if we wanted to, they won't decline to give it to you.
Food review:
I went with the 3 course meal and my partner with 4 courses. We were also given a lot of free stuff (along with every diner in the restaurant) compliments from the chef. We were given a pea soup appetizer, for dessert we were given assortment of chocolate and sweets, and a parting cake gift.
My selection consisted of: Glazed oyster with osetra caviar with zucchini pearls, leeks and lettuce cream,
Roast
Maine
lobster
with potato puree, chanterelle mushrooms, corn and tarragon, and Herb Crusted Loin of Lamb with Summer Vegetable Tian and Polenta. They were all done very well and I would recommend any of these dishes all the meats were cooked perfctly medium rare and just melted in my mouth like butter. They were pretty small in portions and wondered if i would be full and if I made the right choice with a 3 course meal but, luckily the loin of lamb did the job!
My partner ordered the Ahi Tuna, Seared foie gras, with caramelized onions, and cherry, Lemon pepper duck breast with duck hash, bacon braised endive and port glazed cherries, and the Trio of Creme brulee. All were done amazingly and much heartier than my choices. The only dish that was underwhelming for me was the Ahi Tuna, Where the cumin was really present and the lime juice made the dish really acidic as well.
The old fashion I ordered was perfectly mad and one of the best I've had and the Moscow Mule was plenty strong.
End food review
The staff were all exquisite and attentive and could be the best service I've had in a restaurant. There will be two
main
impressions people will have about Gary Danko the Restaurant either you will love it or you'll think it's just okay. I loved my experienced here but, i know many friends who thought it was okay.
Our waiter gave us a little tip after bringing us the bill, If they're full, you can always come by and sit at the bar without reservations. You will be able to order food a la carte and dessert which was great to know for the future. After picking up the bill our waiter also asked us if we need validation, if we used their valet or if he could call a cab for us which was great for them to offer!"

I came here for a fun team dinner because we're all foodies and have had Gary Danko on our bucket lists for a long time now.
We showed up right on time for our reservation and were seated immediately. A total plus at such a popular spot! :) We ordered drinks from the very friendly Som and I got an extra dirty martini because DUH, this is the place to get one. They did take a LONG time to come out! But other than that, it was dirty {blue cheese olives and all} and delightful.
They have a super cool menu setup where you choose the amount of courses that you'd like to taste and can pick anything that you want from their very extensive menu. Heck, if you wanted to choose 4 courses of dessert, you could! There are definitely items on there for everyone! OR you can choose to go with their chef's tasting menu and not have to worry about a thing because let me tell you, narrowing down your options to only 3, 4, or 5 dishes is no easy task at GD! You'll be fighting 'your eyes are bigger than your stomach' the entire time because you're sure to want to try one of everything. While I debated 5 courses for a long time, i'm really happy that I stuck with 4, it ended up being the right amount of food and a good variety of items. The portions are pretty small though, so without the endless amounts of bread they were serving while waiting for the food to come out, I may have still been a tad hungry with only the 4.
Now - here were the courses that I chose!
First Course: Dungeness Crab Salad with Avocado, Citrus, Bulgar and Mustard-Tarragon Vinaigrette; Delicious!!! The tarragon flavor really made it unique and tasty.
Second Course: Poached Farm Egg ""Carbonara"" with Braised Bacon and Brioche; I was super bummed about this dish. When I think Carbonara, I think pasta dish, but this is literally just a poached egg over a VERY TINY cracker. Not a fan!
Third Course:
Roast
Maine
Lobster
with Potato Purée, Chanterelle Mushrooms, Corn and Tarragon; I really enjoyed this course. It was very small in size, i.e. not much
lobster
but flavorful and you do get the claws. Sweet meat and yummy!
Fourth Course: Seared Filet of Beef with Potato Gnocchi, Olive Oil, Swiss Chard and Stilton Butter; MY FAVORITE! I'm a meat and potatoes girl and this was amazing. Thank goodness for this course because I may have still been hungry if it was as tiny as the others.
I opted out of my own dessert but tried some of the others at the table. The Strawberry Souffle was pretty dang incredible! They also bring complimentary mini sweets to your table at the end  of the meal so if you only need a little sweet bite to cap off your meal, I would use your course choices on the
main
dishes!
All in all, the portions were small, service was on the slower side, and to be completely honest, it wasn't the BEST meal that i've ever had in my life. When spending $185 {just for one person} I guess I was expecting a tad bit more 'awe factor'. They definitely have a ton of hype which is great for business but maybe do some research before choosing to dine here! If you're not worried about money, come here; You're sure to have a good meal."

So lets break it down - we got the 5 courses for $124/ person - you can pick whatever you want from each section (appetizer/
main
/ dessert/ etc)
Appetizer:
Poached Farm Egg ""Carbonara"" with Braised Bacon and Brioche - this one was okay, it tasted just like it would sound. The plating was beautiful! Nothing that special about this one.
Salt Cured Foie Gras Torchon with Meyer Lemon Compote, Toasted Pistachios and Country Bread - HOLY MOLY this was the best thing I have ever tasted, my taste buds were on fire. I have never had gras before so this being my first time it set the bar very high. It was so melt in your mouth delicious and you get a little bit of sweet with the compote - ugh this is a must must must try if you get the chance to come here.
Fish & Seafood:
Roast
Maine
Lobster
with Potato Purée, Chanterelle Mushrooms, Corn and Tarragon - who doesn't like
lobster
and creamy dreamy potatoes. This was also a winner in my book, but I think the bass was better if I had to pick one.
Pan Seared Bass with Eggplant-Fennel Marmalade, Broccoli Rabe, Shiitake Mushrooms and Soy-Mustard Glaze - MUST TRY- there is so much umami in this dish. The fresh fish, chewy shiitake mushrooms, and the soy glaze mixed all together is like an explosion in your mouth. Salty and sweet, with earthy tones. I loveeeeeed this dish!
Game & Meat:
Seared Filet of Beef with Potato Gnocchi, Olive Oil, Swiss Chard and Stilton Butter - the steak cut like buttttaaaaaa, it was so good! The only thing I didn't like was there was something that tasted like blue cheese and that totally threw me off guard.
Juniper Crusted Bison with King Trumpet Mushrooms, Cipollini Onions and Wild Nettle Spätzle- this one was ok in my opinion. It was kinda dry.

Dining with the coolest crew ever certainly didn't hurt the situation  - shoutout to Trish S, Kris U, Damien S, Nikki W, Jando S, and Hailey P! The atmosphere wasn't as stuffy as we thought it'd be; we loved that the employees yucked it up with us.

lobster
, fluffy gnocchi, and the most beautiful and exquisite souffle I've ever seen. It was seriously dreamy and everything I hoped it'd be; I squealed.
I can't say it was the most innovative meal I've had, but it was all executed perfectly and there was not one tiny thing I didn't enjoy. Except maybe that one random sequined pillow.

I celebrated my boyfriend's birthday here while we were visiting San Francisco, and we were fortunate enough to be seated in a private booth for just us two! Each table has red roses on it too, which made it quite romantic!
Service was beyond impeccable. There were multiple individuals servicing our table, which made the dinner go very smoothly. They cleared our tables quickly, checked in on us multiple times, served us without any lag time, and refilled our waters without having to ask.
I got the 4-course menu ($106), and my boyfriend got the 5-course menu ($124). They served us each our plates, but we just shared our meals family style.
(0) Thai Soup Amuse Bouche with
Lobster
It was very hearty, light, and flavorful. I wish they would have listed this as part of their menu because it was amazing, even better than some of their menu items.
(1) Risotto with Rock Shrimp, Dungeness Crab, Spring Vegetables, and Beech Mushrooms
Most risottos are unbearably heavy and rich, but this was not. It actually reminded me of a thicker congee, so it was comforting to eat. They were also very generous with the shrimp and crab, which I really appreciated.
(2) Glazed Oysters with Osetra Caviar, White Asparagus, Leeks, and Lettuce Cream
This was the perfect appetizer! The oysters were like little clouds in my mouth because it was just so fluffy and light. But if you're generally not a fan of oysters, I would not recommend it though because it does have a slight ""seafoody"" taste.
(3)
Roast
Maine
Lobster
with Potato Purée, Morel Mushrooms, Edamame, and Tarragon
The
lobster
was perfectly cooked, and the potato purée was a very flavorful ""mashed potato."" I loved the broth that came with the plate! Portion wise, this is a quite small plate, so just be aware if you're choosing this as an entree.
(4) Coconut Thai Curry with Shrimp, Calamari,
Lobster
, Scallops, Candied Peanuts, and Shiitake Mushrooms
OMG. This is a MUST ORDER plate. It was the best dish of the night! You are initially served a plate of white rice, and one of the servers then  places the seafood around the rice and then pours the coconut Thai curry over the rice and seafood. The flavor is so amazing that I honestly wanted another plate or even two! It's just so light and comforting. All the seafood was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth.
(5) Pan Seared Scallops with English Pea-Mint Purée, Asparagus, Fava Beans, and Beech Mushrooms
Scallops were so perfectly cooked! The description also says fava beans, but I think I had lentils with mine. Overall, really solid dish.
(6) Soft Shell Crab with Pancetta,
Roasted
Eggplant, Cucumber and Thai Lime Dressing
This was more like two separate dishes placed onto one plate. The soft shell crab was extremely flavorful, and the herb salad on the side was very refreshing. It reminded me of the inside of a Vietnamese spring roll. Portion wise, this is also a small plate, so just be aware.
(7)
Roasted
Quail Stuffed with Mushroom Ragout, Leeks, Quinoa, and Foie Gras with Baby Artichokes and Green Garlic
It doesn't say in the description, but it's served with a mini corn bread cake, which I loved! The quail was super adorable and petite. I thought it was pretty great but nothing too special. The quail drumsticks were probably the highlight of this dish.
(8) Lemon Pepper Duck Breast with Duck Hash, Bacon Braised Endive, and Port Glazed Cherries
That duck breast was the definition of perfection. It was so well cooked and delicious. If you're not used to gamey meats, then beware that it is a tad more chewy than beef. As for the duck hash and all the sides, I could care less for them. Those were just okay.
(9) Trio Creme Brûlée with Assorted Cookies
There are 3 creme brûlée: Vanilla Bean, Brandy, and Blueberry Lemongrass. The vanilla is the classic one, and I just thought it was so yummy. The brandy one is a bit too rich and heavy, so I didn't really enjoy it. The blueberry lemongrass one was a beautiful dark purple color, and it was tart in flavor. The assorted cookies were just okay.
(Extra) Complimentary Assorted Dessert Plate
We received 8 bite-sized desserts that were all different in flavor. There was only one that I didn't enjoy, which was the red jelly one. Otherwise, I would recommend trying all of them because they were delicious.
(Extra) Complimentary Birthday Chocolate Mousse Cake
This was very sweet of them to bring out for my boyfriend's birthday. If you truly love the flavor of chocolate, then this is the dessert for you. It is not like the grocery market chocolate. It has a more rich, bitter chocolate flavor to it that is amazing on the palate.

My boyfriend and I made our reservation two months in advance for our anniversary and although service was nice, the food was mediocre, at best. It's possible I came on a bad day...or I just don't have the palate for the food.
This place has been on my ""foodie wish list"" for a long ass time. I've heard so many good things about it! So for two months, I looked forward to dining here and even planned out what I was going to order, lol.
We ordered two cocktails and (2) four-course meals, consisting of:
-Risotto with Rock Shrimp, Dungeness Crab, Spring Vegetables and Beech Mushrooms: this was creamy and rich as expected, filled with seafood, but I'm simply not a risotto person (this was bf's choice)
-Seared Foie Gras with Caramelized Onions and Cherries: this was better than many of the things we ordered, but nothing to rave about
-
Roast
Maine
Lobster
with Potato Purée, Morel Mushrooms, Edamame and Tarragon: the
lobster
was cooked to perfection. a good portion, but missing something.
-Coriander, Black Pepper and Rosemary Crusted Tuna with Pipérade, Spinach and Anchovy-Garlic Essence: eh this was ok
-Pan Seared Scallops with English Pea-Mint Purée, Asparagus, Fava Beans and Beech Mushrooms: probably my favorite dish *_* the scallops were huge and flavorful.
-Herb Crusted Loin of Lamb with Spring Vegetable Tian and Polenta: wasn't memorable
-Seared Filet of Beef with Potato Gnocchi, Olive Oil, Swiss Chard and Stilton Butter: this was probably the worst thing we ordered...there was literally no seasoning on the beef. it tasted so bland.
- Juniper Crusted Bison with King Trumpet Mushrooms, Cipollini Onions and Wild Nettle Spätzle: meat was tender and flavorful, but eh.
After finishing our food, we were given a small plate of assorted baked goods, which we appreciated, but we didn't receive the complementary celebration cake/mousse with a candle that everyone else has mentioned (note that I included in our reservation that this was to celebrate our anniversary). That left a sour taste in my mouth because I saw other tables receive it.
Aside from all of the above, the only thing that deserves stars is their service - they were very attentive and refilled our waters (most of the time) and gave us bread. I appreciated that while I was in the restroom, they brought our food and they put an old dutch lid on our dishes until I came out.
We also got two baked goods to take home for the next day, which was nice. But again, mediocre at best. None of the items we ordered stood out. So it makes me wonder - do you come here for the food? Or for the service?
Not to mention, my boyfriend felt sick all night after eating Gary Danko...so we're definitely not coming back. Terribly disappointed with our experience."

of
those places my then boyfriend/now husband and I dreamed
of
dining in. We were in our very early 20s and working our minimum wage jobs, wishing that one day we could eat here. Fast forward to present time, my husband surprised me for my 30th birthday and booked a table here.
We had a 9:30pm reservation and from the beginning to end, the service was spectacular. We arrived 10 mins early and were seated right away. They sat us next to each other against the wall in view
of
everybody. As our host said, ""Great seats for people watching.""
My husband and I chose the 4 course meal and I love how you're not limited to each section
of
the menu. There were many options and we wanted to try as much as we could, so we both got different things. We each ordered an appetizer, seafood and 2 meat dishes. The food was soooo good. A lot
of
the things we ordered were things we both were trying for the first time.
We ordered the risotto,
seared
foie gras,
seared
scallops, roast maine lobster, juniper crusted bison,
filet
of
beef
, stuffed quail and lemon pepper duck breast. Although they were all delicious, the highlights
of
the meal were the risotto,
seared
foie gras, duck breast and bison. The dishes were timed and spaced out perfectly throughout the evening. We didn't feel like we had to wait too long in between entrees, nor did we feel rushed. At the end
of
our meal, they gave us a small tray
of
mini desserts and a complementary birthday dessert. They also gave us a pumpkin cream cheese muffin to take home, which was a nice touch.
Overall, my husband and I had a great time and both agreed that this was our favorite dining (and fanciest) experiences to date. It was a great way to celebrate my birthday! We left the restaurant at almost midnight. Those 2 hours flew by and we didn't even realize it because we were having such a great time. No phones, just quality time, good food and good conversation. We will definitely be back."

I have been here four or five times over the last few years for special occasions and it is worth every penny. If you are looking for fine dining but actually want to recognize what the dishes on the menu are, this place is for you.
The first time we came, we did 5 courses each. We left and we're absolutely stuffed (like barely breathing), so ever since we've opted for four.
I'll start with the service:
First off, I'm a sucker for bread and butter and love any restaurant that comes and refills my bread plate when they see it's empty.
Secondly, when you get up and go to the bathroom, they come and put a cover over your food so it stays warm. If that's not great service then I don't know what is.
Lastly, the staff is incredibly friendly, taking the time to answer questions and check in throughout the meal. When I dine there I truly feel like I am treated like royalty, which is nice when you're dropping a lot
of
money.
Then there's the food. I could go on and on but instead I'll share my dishes from my most recent visit:
Appetizer- the risotto. I'm not sure if this changes with the seasons because I typically go in July every year, but it usually has rock shrimp, crab and vegetables in it and is delightful.
Fish: roast main lobster with potato purée. Hands down my favorite dish with the exception
of
dessert, which we'll get to soon.
Meat:
seared
filet
of
beef
. Good steak. Probably my least favorite
of
the bunch but not because it's not good, the other dishes are just spectacular.
Cheese: they roll out a cart and let you select a few.
Dessert: warm Louisiana butter cake. This is no joke. My boyfriend and I literally talk about this more often than people should. Hands down the best dessert I've ever had in my life. I would pay $50 for this alone.
When you leave, they give you a treat to go, which is a nice touch. Overall, you'll spend a lot
of
money but it is so worth it."

choosing either a 3, 4 or 5 course meal ($92, $113, or $134).  She went with a gluten-free 4 courses, and I went for 5.  The menu had a lot

Went this past Sunday since my friend wanted to treat so I couldn't pass that up. Our reservation was for 9:30pm but they were running behind so we grabbed drinks at the bar. A ""little"" behind turned into being a 30 minute wait. The manager or whoever apologized and offered us complimentary rose and mentioned that we would get a couple complimentary appetizers and dessert as well. That was a nice gesture, but what would've been nice was for him to comp our drinks that we bought at the bar instead. Just my preference vs the free champagne/small ass appetizers aka two teaspoons
of
soup and a small raw salmon bite on a circular cookie looking thing? It was ok. I really wanted to fall in love with this place but it's overhyped for sure. My favorite dishes were the roast main lobster, scallops,
seared

filet
of

was meh the sides on there tasted better and the lemon pepper duck was ok as well, What the heck Gary Danko? Maybe my expectations were too high. Also, the
seared
ahi tuna had WAYYY too much lemon soy dressing on there. I'm kinda glad I didn't have to pay for this meal I didn't think it was that worth it to me. Such a random thought, but halfway through the dinner I was thinking that I'd rather go to House
of
Prime rib lol. Overall, I didn't come super hungry, but I thought the portions are a little small for my liking. Nice presentation and service here, but I think this was just a one time thing for me.

Where can I begin...
Food: This was our 3rd or 4th time we came to Gary Danko. I am amazed that the quality
of
food and execution hasn't changed a bit compared to 5 years ago, which I find it rare in this city. They offer fabulous selection
of
menu and the only hard part is that you don't know what to order without getting your brains tangled up.
This time (and I think every time in the past...) I had:
1.
Seared
ahi tuna - melts like butter and perfectly and lightly flavored with lemon soy dressing. Very light and pleasant appetizer to start your meal.
2. Roast Main Lobster - the lobster is perfectly cooked and very plumped, and nicely balanced with smooth potato purée and chanterelle mushrooms.
3.
Seared
Filet
of
Beef
- the
filet
was cooked perfect medium rare, tender, buttery, juicy... just everything you ask for in a perfect stake.
4. Last but certainly not least, the one and only, baked Chocolate soufflé. - at this point I am pretty full with 3 plates and a cocktail, but this is the finale what I always look forward to! I love the little presentation from a waiter pouring the two separate sauces in front
of
you, first with vanilla bean cream and second with dark Belgian chocolate sauce. The soufflé is incredibly fluffy and soft, never too rich or too sweet, but the sophisticated chocolate flavor will just take you to another world.
Service: the best, top notch, attentive service you can ever ask for. All staff is professional, knowledgeable and friendly.
Last time what I was impressed the most was how attentive they are. They must be a hybrid with hawk, and these eyes are watching you at all time. I spilled the Chocolate soufflé on my jacket hanging on my legs, and one second later before I even finished saying oh nooooo, someone already flew out to me with cleaning wipes to help me clean.
This time, when I arrived at the restaurant I asked for the restroom, and this nice gentleman went out
of
his way to escort me to the restroom. What a nice gesture to make your visit just even better than perfect.
We've tried Quince, La Folie, Alexander... but I think Gary Danko is my favorite
of
all time.

The ambiance is warm and inviting.  The decor is settle and tastefully done.  Our waiter offered a purse hanger so that I had somewhere to put my handbag while we enjoyed our experience.
I started with the rose champagne, a little pricey buy delicious and refreshing.  We all ordered the 4 option meal.  They have a tasting menu with their most popular items and an option to add wine to each dish.  They also have 3 options where you can chose 3,4, or 5 course meal.  What you'd do is pick a dish from their menu, it can be any combination you would like.  My starter was asparagus cold soup to cleanse the palate.  Then I ordered the risotto with rock shrimp, lobster, and crab meat.  Delicious!!!  The dish was prepared with a wonderful combination

taste and the presentation was beautiful.  Next I had the Thai Coconut Curry and seafood dish.  The curry was super light and tasty as well.  Then I had the

of
places to try for ten years. It doesn't look like the menu has changed much either as it stays true to classic French technique. We came to celebrate mother's day with my family and while there were some highs and lows, I'm glad I finally got to try it.
The menu concept is interesting as you can choose between 3-, 4-, and 5-course tasting menus. The interesting part is that you could choose whatever you want, including all appetizers, all desserts, or even all main entrees. One
of
the low points was our experience with the sommelier, who seemed to look down on us when we ordered a half bottle
of
wine between three people (we don't drink much). Although his eventual recommended wine was good, we didn't appreciate his judgmental attitude.
As for the food, we started with appetizers including the risotto with rock shrimp, Dungeness crab, asparagus, and beech mushrooms. While the risotto was good, the flavors were very one-note, but loved the shrimp and crab. The salt cured foie gras torchon with Meyer lemon jam, charred baby leeks, smoked almonds and country bread was my favorite. The foie gras was so rich and creamy, and was the perfect complement to the toast. For mains, the roast Maine lobster is a signature dish that is a must-try. It's both elegant and a classic. For my last entree, I tried the juniper crusted bison, which surprisingly wasn't gamey at all. I also tried a taste
of
the
seared
filet
of
beef
, which was cooked perfectly. The roasted quail stuffed with mushrooms was also a great dish.
We skipped the cheese course and tried a couple desserts including the trio
of
creme brulee with assorted cookies, and the recommended warm Louisiana butter cake. As with many fine dining restaurants, I wasn't as impressed by the dessert. The butter cake wasn't as moist as the one I've had at Maestro's and the creme brulee, while good, didn't have my favorite flavors.
The night ended with us receiving a pineapple cheesecake for the next day and a rose for the women for mother's day, which was a nice touch. The ambiance was romantic enough for a nice date, but also fits for family gatherings. With so many consistent years
of
food and service, it's no wonder it has retained its one star Michelin."

Ambiance - 3/5
Food - 4/5
Overall experience for this visit would be 3.5 stars, but I'll round up to 4 until I return for another experience.
Came here with my family to celebrate my mom's birthday. We arrived separately; my family arrived ~15 mins before scheduled time (they got sited right away, which was nice), I arrived ~5 mins late to the reservation.
When I arrived to the restaurant, there was no one at the entrance to greet me, I had to look around the room for my family and walk myself to the table.
After I've sat down, we waited at least 15~20 mins before our waiter checked-in with us and started explaining the menu. I understand that they were waiting for everyone to be here before talking about the menu, but I'm shocked that they waited almost 20 mins before they stopped by. (Maybe they didn't notice that I have arrived? or forgot that we have yet to order?)
Our waiter was very nice once we started interacting with him, he gave recommendations throughout the ordering process and checked-in with us a couple times throughout the meal. However the waitress who was refilling water and bread might have a wrong understanding
of
""good service"". She was doing everything super fast; pouring water way too fast (splashing water everywhere), putting (or more like throwing) bread down on your plate. Fast service is part
of
good service, but not all
of
it; I was constantly distracted/surprised by her quick movement around the table and was concerned that she would splash water on my food or on me. The sommelier who came to help us was even worse. He was rude and had an attitude that he didn't want to help us (maybe because
of
the price
of
the bottle we were looking at?) He told us he will look in the cellar for a recommendation, but didn't return until 15 mins later; during that time we saw that he was pouring wine for other tables, we actually thought that he decided to ignore us because we were ordering a cheap bottle.
I will give it to them that our wine glass, water glass, and bread plate were never empty throughout.
The ambiance wasn't that great either. Table arrangements are pretty crowed (waiters have to squeeze sideways between my chair and the person sitting behind me to get through) and background noise is pretty loud (to the point where I have to lean in for the person across me to hear me), not what I expected from a fine dinning restaurant with a Michelin star. There are many restaurants that serve the same quality food, and have better service and ambiance.

the staff squeezed so tight up next to my table with his back turned to speak these guys. I felt uncomfortable as they are loud and our sense our special dinner was sort
of
taken away.
Would I come back again? I'm willing to give them another try. Was I full off
of

with potato gnocchi.  My boyfriend had the (1) Coconut Thai curry with shrimp, calamari, lobster, scallops, and mushrooms, (2)

I like that you can customize your 3, 4, or 5 courses - choosing from any section
of
the menu.  Meaning, you could get 4 options from the dessert section or 3
filets
of
beef
if you so choose.  I'm not a dessert person and was thrilled to not be forced to have that as a course as so many other places do.  They will modify the portion sizing depending on what you are ordering.  So if you get two appetizers and a
filet
, the
filet
will be larger in size than if you were to get two other meat options with the
filet
.
In my opinion, the gnocchi was the best thing I tasted.  I would have preferred all gnocchi and no
filet
!  The steak was okay.  My boyfriend who is not as into food as I am raved about the cheesecake and actually called his meal ""out
of
this world.""  A phrase I don't believe I've ever heard him utter.
We were happy with the portion sizes - its not like the commercial
of
the couple who go to the fancy restaurant and have to stop at the convenience store on the way home to get more food.  But, considering you're paying $30 for each course, you should be full!
Nice touch to send everyone home with a wonderful pineapple sponge cake for the next day.  Delicious!!

The food here is solid and French - great ingredients transformed into dishes that are perfectly executed. I chose 5 items - surf (oysters with caviar, branzini), turf (
seared
foie,
filet
of
beef
) and the perfect dessert (lemon soufflé cake) with mignardises.  At the end
of
the meal, they gave me a small cake to take home.  I really appreciate the variety and number
of
items in their menu (I'm a little tired
of
set tasting menus at the moment).  I also like that this restaurant gives you a lot
of
bread (yes - I used it to soak up lots
of
the sauces).
Tom, the bartender, was the perfect host for my meal. He did a fantastic and fun job making non-alcoholic pairings for me.  Hospitality was excellent.
As for the ambiance, it's very old San Francisco (probably time for a remodel and the place is a bit dark) and feels very dated when compared to the other Michelin-starred restaurants in SF.
I would highly recommend this place for anyone looking for fine dining who is visiting Fisherman's Wharf.  The attire is business casual (dark jeans ok) but I saw a really good range
of
clothing when I visited, particularly from tourists who look like they just finished a whole day
of
sight-seeing in SF.  I look forward to my next visit to try the other items on the enormous menu."

My boyfriend and I made a last minute attempt to get reservations for our anniversary and were lucky enough to snag a table around 9pm on a weekday night only days in advance.
We arrived a little early and were invited to wait at the bar in the meantime, though we opted not to as the bar area was quite packed that night. Speaking
of
packed, the restaurant isn't all that large from what I could tell and so the volume is pretty high, just a fair warning.
I honestly don't pay too much attention to service and so I'm just going to skip that and go right into the menu and the food.
I really loved the structure
of
the menu as it allowed my boyfriend and I to try a great variety. You don't have to choose one appetizer, one main, one dessert, etc. If you want to choose all meats? Go ahead! If you have an uncontrollable sweet tooth and want to order just desserts? By all means go for it!!
My boyfriend and I each chose a 3 course meal and our selections were oysters,
seared
foie gras, lobster, duck, quail, &
filet
of
beef
(we went the meat, meat, and more meat route).
The oysters were wonderfully sweet with a beautiful pop
of
flavor from the caviar. The foie gras was by far my favorite and was not only wonderfully rich, but quite largely portioned as well (though not large enough to share with a ravenous boyfriend, I would probably order two
of
these next time!!). The lobster was flavorful and had an almost buttery texture to it that we really enjoyed (this plate would end up being my least favorite though, because I just felt like the other things on the plate didn't really complement the lobster). All the meats were incredibly tender and paired well with their accompaniments, especially the quail, and all three were fairly large portions.
At the end
of
the meal, we were treated with an extremely rich chocolate dessert as we were celebrating our anniversary and were also given a small plate
of
sweets as well as a parting gift (a delicious pumpkin and cream cheese muffin).
All in all, we really enjoyed our meal and would gladly come again!!"

Well kids they definitely sweep them off here! Gary Danko happened to be at the top
of
my list on my recent foodie trip to SF. I have heard
of
people making reservations months in advance with some only getting a 9:30pm time slot. However, luck was on my side when the concierge at the Ritz Carlton scored me a reservation same day with a 6pm time slot!!! I wanted my kids to experience their first Michelin star restaurant so I couldn't be more thrilled! We arrived much earlier than our reservation but they took us anyway. We had a nice table at the main dining area where the bar is. I would say the tables are close but not so close you can hear the conversations nearby. The ordering system is pretty simple. You can pick any 3/4/5 items from the menu. You have the freedom to choose anything you want....if you want 5 desserts or even 5 steaks you can order just that! My two cents- order mainly fish/meats and skip the desserts. They will give you a free sampler
of
mini desserts at the end and a complimentary one you are celebrating a special occasion. They also give everyone a free small soup. Just things to keep in mind before ordering.
Here are the items I ordered:
Seared
Foie Gras with Caramelized Onions and Apples- I have never tried duck liver before. To me it just tasted like a super buttery piece
of
fat. It wasn't exciting.
Pan
Seared
Bass with Israeli Couscous, Broccoli, Glazed Turnips and Radish- If bass is on the menu I will always order it. However this one was a bit more stiff to my liking. I prefer the bass that is delicate and melts in your mouth. Nonetheless it was still good.
Seared
Filet
of
Beef
with Potato Gnocchi Olive Oil, Swiss Chard and Stilton Butter- I ordered this for my kids as they love steak. They enjoyed it but it isn't something I would have ordered.
Herb Crusted Loin
of
Lamb with Farrotto, Medjool Dates, Rainbow Carrots and Green Chermoula- My favorite dish
of
the evening! The lamb was deliciously tender and moist. The dates added a bit
of
sweetness.
With over 50 items on the menu it was tough picking just 4! I am looking forward to coming back to try different items on the menu. This is one
of
the more reasonably priced Michelin star restaurants I have dined at. If you don't order alcohol you can easily have an affordable nice dining experience here. Service is perfect as expected. You have about 4-5 people waiting on your every move. When you leave to use the restroom your napkin has magically been folded and hanging on your chair when you return. They even provide purse holders for the ladies. Do not forget to take home the muffins they give you at end. Seriously the best you will ever have! Tasted perfect with my morning coffee! THANK YOU GARY DANKO! This was definitely the highlight on our trip to SF!"

Pretty difficult to find parking as you can expect. It was super cold that evening and we were lucky enough to snag a parking spot only a block and a half away. They offer valet service for $20 if you aren't lucky with parking.
The restaurant's exterior wasn't what I had imagined for some reason. You couldn't see anything in the restaurant as all the windows were tinted black. We were in for a surprise, but a wonderful one. It was very elegant inside. We came a few minutes past our reservation time as we made a quick pit stop to Patagonia a block away. Our reservation time was 5:30 which was when they opened. I was surprised to see so many people sitting down already. That was fast.
You have the option
of
choosing the tasting menu or a 3-4-5 course meal. We went for the 4-course meal. What I loved about this option was that even though you were given the option
of
appetizers, seafood, meats, and desserts, you could choose four
of
ANYTHING. It doesn't necessarily have to go in what you'd think as the proper sequence (appetizer, entree, dessert), although you could do it that way if you wanted to. It could be four entrees... all lobster if you wanted! I skipped out on the appetizers and went straight to the entrees, heh.
Originally I had ordered four entrees, BUT when I got to my third course, I started getting a bit full. Luckily, they were still able to change my fourth course into a dessert rather than the
seared
filet
of
beef
I had ordered. The waiter recommended getting a dessert when I was placing my initial order as my fourth course since it was my first time, but I definitely overestimated my appetite and turned down the dessert option. He knew all along, ha. Anyways - what I had ordered was the roast maine lobster,
seared
sea scallops, lemon pepper duck breast, and the chocolate souffle with two sauces. I think my top two favorites were the scallops and the duck breast. Both were so tender. Although the lobster was good (such a drastic change from the horrible overcooked lobster I had at that buffet in Reno omg), lobster never seems to wow me just because I've never been a huge fan
of
it. My boyfriend order the roast maine lobster, coconut thai curry with an assortment
of
seafood, herb crusted loin
of
lamb, and the duck breast as well. His coconut thai curry tasted more like a bisque than it did curry, but was still very good. I definitely wouldn't have ordered dessert as my fourth course if I knew we were going to be served an assortment
of
tiny desserts along with the free birthday dessert for my boyfriend.
At the end
of
our meal, we were given these nicely packaged desserts to take home with us. They were banana cream cheese cakes I believe!
Honestly, I would have been content with a 3-course meal.. it was too much food for one night! I guess it really depends on what you order and how hungry you really are.
Food was great, definitely super filling if you order the right things. Service was top notch. That's the one thing that stood out the most for me. Water was refilled almost instantly. And so was the bread. I found it kind
of
funny that my bread was refilled within a second
of
grabbing my final piece. They were so on top
of
everything, I loved it!
Definitely a great place to celebrate a special occasion!"

We arrived 5 minutes early for our reservation but got seated right away. Service is on point here! They don't rush you to order, they constantly refill your water without having to ask, refill bread on your plate once you run out, and change your utensils each time a new course comes out (even if you didn't use the utensils). The meals are set from 3 courses ($89), 4 courses ($109) or 5 courses ($128). The food is set by ""Appetizers"", ""Fish and Seafood"", ""Meat and Game Birds"", ""Cheese"", and ""Dessert"". You can choose the food you want from any section. They start you off with a soup before your courses. My boyfriend and I went with the 3 courses.
The food we got were:
Appetizers:
-
Seared
Foie Gras with Caramelized Onions and Apples
- Risotto with Rock Shrimp, Dungeness Crab, Root Vegetables, Sage and Beech Mushrooms

Me and my bf did the 5 course meal, cause we were thinking if this place is super expensive and we don't get to go here often, why not go all out and try everything. Most people would probably do fine with the 4 courses, as me and my bf were both really full by the end and we do eat a lot. Before I forget valet parking is $20 but you can definitely find street parking nearby (although it may be a limit
of
2 hours)
In terms
of
menu items:
Seared
foie gras with carmelized onions and apples - 10/10!!!!
omg this was the tastiest thing I have ever eaten in my life. the foie gras was super delectable and soft and filled with lots
of
flavor. It was small, but it was definitely one
of
my top choices after trying the other things I picked
Risotto with rock shrimp - 6.5/10
I'm not sure if I'm a fan
of
risotto, I may not be as I thought this was a little salty. My bf however thought it was really really good!
Seared
scallops - 10/10!!
These scallops tasted so good and was super soft with every bite. I felt like I was eating a meal from hells kitchen LOL. There was also this thing in the middle that I couldn't tell what it was, some sort
of
potato cake? It was super good too. I couldn't exaclty figure out the flavors but this was both one
of
me and my bf's favorite dish. definitely recommend this one if you're going here.
Horseradish crusted salmon medallion with dilled cucumbers and mustard sauce - 8/10
The salmon was super soft and not fully cooked, which was good cause it wasn't dry like other salmons  you would have at other restaurants. I like dill so I automatically enjoyed this dish, and the mustard sauce was tangy and gave you a kick too. I enjoyed the scallops more though.
Roasted Quail with stuffed mushroom and pumpkin orzo - 10/10!!!
This was probably my favorite dish out
of
the whole night! I thought the quail would be too much work but it wasn't and the stuffing in there was super tasty! the quail itself was sweet and nicely roasted as well. the pumpkin orzo was a good addition too. this is the other dish i would definitely recommend getting here!!
Lemon Pepper duck breast with pears - 9/10
The duck itself was good but it was paired with some sort
of
crabcake which kind
of
confused me and my bf cause it felt like it didn't go together, but it was nice that they included it anyway LOL. and the pears were pretty good too and they had some sort
of
fried fats on the side which went well with the dish. I think if the crabcake didn't throw me off I would have given this a 10/10 though.
Herb crusted loin
of
lamb with dates - 10/10
This was a lot better than i was thinking! I don't like lamb much but this dish didn't taste too gamey or anything, and the stuff underneath it was good too! another one i would recommend that you have to try when you come here.
Seared
Filet
of
beef
with gnocci - 6/10
Both me and my bf didn't really enjoy this too much, but i think its cause we realized we don't like
filet
. it was nicely cooked but i think the cut was just too thick for us so at one point it was just like eating raw meat. the potato gnocci was good but that's about it.
Flambeed pineapple with olive oil and rosemary cake  10/10
this dessert was definitely exotic and you get a show right in front
of
you! it's an extra $6 but definitely worth it.
Grand marnier souffle - 6/10
this didn't impress me and I guess it just felt like too much egg white? or maybe I just never had a graasp on what souffle was but both me and my bf did not enjoy this as much LOL so i would recommend the other desserts.
Espresso Martini - 8/10
This was definitely a unique drink that I recommend if you are going to get a drink! ive never seen it anywhere else and it literally was a mix
of
both espresso and martini.
Besides the food, even though I didn't think every dish was 10/10, service was very good and the whole restaurant was super sophisticated and there were some amazing dishes, and  that was enough for me to give 5/5 on our whole experience. our total bill with tip and tap ended up being around $400 but that was mainly bc we got 3 drinks and got the 5 course. definitely will come back here one day when i have a real job!
OVERALL: get the
seared
scallops, roasted quail, foie gras, herb crusted lamb, and flambeed pineapple!"

dining in. We were in our very early 20s and working our minimum wage jobs, wishing that one day we could eat here. Fast forward to present time, my husband surprised me for my 30th birthday and booked a table here.
We had a 9:30pm reservation and from the beginning to end, the service was spectacular. We arrived 10 mins early and were seated right away. They sat us next to each other against the wall in view
of
everybody. As our host said, ""Great seats for people watching.""
My husband and I chose the 4 course meal and I love how you're not limited to each section
of
the menu. There were many options and we wanted to try as much as we could, so we both got different things. We each ordered an appetizer, seafood and 2 meat dishes. The food was soooo good. A lot
of
the things we ordered were things we both were trying for the first time.
We ordered the risotto,
seared
foie gras,
seared
scallops, roast maine lobster, juniper crusted bison,
filet
of
beef
, stuffed quail and lemon pepper duck breast. Although they were all delicious, the highlights
of
the meal were the risotto,
seared
foie gras, duck breast and bison. The dishes were timed and spaced out perfectly throughout the evening. We didn't feel like we had to wait too long in between entrees, nor did we feel rushed. At the end
of
our meal, they gave us a small tray
of
mini desserts and a complementary birthday dessert. They also gave us a pumpkin cream cheese muffin to take home, which was a nice touch.
Overall, my husband and I had a great time and both agreed that this was our favorite dining (and fanciest) experiences to date. It was a great way to celebrate my birthday! We left the restaurant at almost midnight. Those 2 hours flew by and we didn't even realize it because we were having such a great time. No phones, just quality time, good food and good conversation.

I have been here four or five times over the last few years for special occasions and it is worth every penny. If you are looking for fine dining but actually want to recognize what the dishes on the menu are, this place is for you.
The first time we came, we did 5 courses each. We left and we're absolutely stuffed (like barely breathing), so ever since we've opted for four.
I'll start with the service:
First off, I'm a sucker for bread and butter and love any restaurant that comes and refills my bread plate when they see it's empty.
Secondly, when you get up and go to the bathroom, they come and put a cover over your food so it stays warm. If that's not great service then I don't know what is.
Lastly, the staff is incredibly friendly, taking the time to answer questions and check in throughout the meal. When I dine there I truly feel like I am treated like royalty, which is nice when you're dropping a lot
of
money.
Then there's the food. I could go on and on but instead I'll share my dishes from my most recent visit:
Appetizer- the risotto. I'm not sure if this changes with the seasons because I typically go in July every year, but it usually has rock shrimp, crab and vegetables in it and is delightful.
Fish: roast main lobster with potato purée. Hands down my favorite dish with the exception
of
dessert, which we'll get to soon.
Meat:
seared
filet
of
beef
. Good steak. Probably my least favorite
of
the bunch but not because it's not good, the other dishes are just spectacular.
Cheese: they roll out a cart and let you select a few.
Dessert: warm Louisiana butter cake. This is no joke. My boyfriend and I literally talk about this more often than people should. Hands down the best dessert I've ever had in my life. I would pay $50 for this alone.
When you leave, they give you a treat to go, which is a nice touch. Overall, you'll spend a lot

A ""little"" behind turned into being a 30 minute wait. The manager or whoever apologized and offered us complimentary rose and mentioned that we would get a couple complimentary appetizers and dessert as well. That was a nice gesture, but what would've been nice was for him to comp our drinks that we bought at the bar instead. Just my preference vs the free champagne/small ass appetizers aka two teaspoons

Where can I begin...
Food: This was our 3rd or 4th time we came to Gary Danko. I am amazed that the quality
of
food and execution hasn't changed a bit compared to 5 years ago, which I find it rare in this city. They offer fabulous selection
of
menu and the only hard part is that you don't know what to order without getting your brains tangled up.
This time (and I think every time in the past...) I had:
1.
Seared
ahi tuna - melts like butter and perfectly and lightly flavored with lemon soy dressing. Very light and pleasant appetizer to start your meal.
2. Roast Main Lobster - the lobster is perfectly cooked and very plumped, and nicely balanced with smooth potato purée and chanterelle mushrooms.
3.
Seared
Filet
of
Beef
- the
filet
was cooked perfect medium rare, tender, buttery, juicy... just everything you ask for in a perfect stake.
4. Last but certainly not least, the one and only, baked Chocolate soufflé. - at this point I am pretty full with 3 plates and a cocktail, but this is the finale what I always look forward to! I love the little presentation from a waiter pouring the two separate sauces in front
of
you, first with vanilla bean cream and second with dark Belgian chocolate sauce. The soufflé is incredibly fluffy and soft, never too rich or too sweet, but the sophisticated chocolate flavor will just take you to another world.
Service: the best, top notch, attentive service you can ever ask for. All staff is professional, knowledgeable and friendly.
Last time what I was impressed the most was how attentive they are. They must be a hybrid with hawk, and these eyes are watching you at all time. I spilled the Chocolate soufflé on my jacket hanging on my legs, and one second later before I even finished saying oh nooooo, someone already flew out to me with cleaning wipes to help me clean.
This time, when I arrived at the restaurant I asked for the restroom, and this nice gentleman went out
of
his way to escort me to the restroom. What a nice gesture to make your visit just even better than perfect.
We've tried Quince, La Folie, Alexander... but I think Gary Danko is my favorite
of
all time.
I Absolutely cannot wait to go back again!"

The ambiance is warm and inviting.  The decor is settle and tastefully done.  Our waiter offered a purse hanger so that I had somewhere to put my handbag while we enjoyed our experience.
I started with the rose champagne, a little pricey buy delicious and refreshing.  We all ordered the 4 option meal.  They have a tasting menu with their most popular items and an option to add wine to each dish.  They also have 3 options where you can chose 3,4, or 5 course meal.  What you'd do is pick a dish from their menu, it can be any combination you would like.  My starter was asparagus cold soup to cleanse the palate.  Then I ordered the risotto with rock shrimp, lobster, and crab meat.  Delicious!!!  The dish was prepared with a wonderful combination
of
taste and the presentation was beautiful.  Next I had the Thai Coconut Curry and seafood dish.  The curry was super light and tasty as well.  Then I had the
Seared
Filet
of
Beef
made medium.  This dish was a little disappointing, the meat was over cooked and a little tough.  The waiter was very attentive and offered to make me another dish, but I declined because I didn't want to waste food.  The bread man was always at our table filling out bread plate.  Upon seeing it, didn't look as good as it taste!  The bread was warm, soft, and oh so yummy!  Lastly for dessert I had the butter cake.  By now I was quite full and could not finish my dessert, but it was moist and not too sweet.
My overall experience at Gary Danko was A+.  I would love to come again next time we are in the Bay Area."

of
places to try for ten years. It doesn't look like the menu has changed much either as it stays true to classic French technique. We came to celebrate mother's day with my family and while there were some highs and lows, I'm glad I finally got to try it.
The menu concept is interesting as you can choose between 3-, 4-, and 5-course tasting menus. The interesting part is that you could choose whatever you want, including all appetizers, all desserts, or even all main entrees. One
of
the low points was our experience with the sommelier, who seemed to look down on us when we ordered a half bottle
of
wine between three people (we don't drink much). Although his eventual recommended wine was good, we didn't appreciate his judgmental attitude.
As for the food, we started with appetizers including the risotto with rock shrimp, Dungeness crab, asparagus, and beech mushrooms. While the risotto was good, the flavors were very one-note, but loved the shrimp and crab. The salt cured foie gras torchon with Meyer lemon jam, charred baby leeks, smoked almonds and country bread was my favorite. The foie gras was so rich and creamy, and was the perfect complement to the toast. For mains, the roast Maine lobster is a signature dish that is a must-try. It's both elegant and a classic. For my last entree, I tried the juniper crusted bison, which surprisingly wasn't gamey at all. I also tried a taste
of
the
seared
filet
of
beef
, which was cooked perfectly. The roasted quail stuffed with mushrooms was also a great dish.
We skipped the cheese course and tried a couple desserts including the trio
of
creme brulee with assorted cookies, and the recommended warm Louisiana butter cake. As with many fine dining restaurants, I wasn't as impressed by the dessert. The butter cake wasn't as moist as the one I've had at Maestro's and the creme brulee, while good, didn't have my favorite flavors.
The night ended with us receiving a pineapple cheesecake for the next day and a rose for the women for mother's day, which was a nice touch. The ambiance was romantic enough for a nice date, but also fits for family gatherings. With so many consistent years
of
food and service, it's no wonder it has retained its one star Michelin."

Ambiance - 3/5
Food - 4/5
Overall experience for this visit would be 3.5 stars, but I'll round up to 4 until I return for another experience.
Came here with my family to celebrate my mom's birthday. We arrived separately; my family arrived ~15 mins before scheduled time (they got sited right away, which was nice), I arrived ~5 mins late to the reservation.
When I arrived to the restaurant, there was no one at the entrance to greet me, I had to look around the room for my family and walk myself to the table.
After I've sat down, we waited at least 15~20 mins before our waiter checked-in with us and started explaining the menu. I understand that they were waiting for everyone to be here before talking about the menu, but I'm shocked that they waited almost 20 mins before they stopped by. (Maybe they didn't notice that I have arrived? or forgot that we have yet to order?)
Our waiter was very nice once we started interacting with him, he gave recommendations throughout the ordering process and checked-in with us a couple times throughout the meal. However the waitress who was refilling water and bread might have a wrong understanding
of
""good service"". She was doing everything super fast; pouring water way too fast (splashing water everywhere), putting (or more like throwing) bread down on your plate. Fast service is part
of
good service, but not all
of
it; I was constantly distracted/surprised by her quick movement around the table and was concerned that she would splash water on my food or on me. The sommelier who came to help us was even worse. He was rude and had an attitude that he didn't want to help us (maybe because
of
the price
of
the bottle we were looking at?) He told us he will look in the cellar for a recommendation, but didn't return until 15 mins later; during that time we saw that he was pouring wine for other tables, we actually thought that he decided to ignore us because we were ordering a cheap bottle.
I will give it to them that our wine glass, water glass, and bread plate were never empty throughout.
The ambiance wasn't that great either. Table arrangements are pretty crowed (waiters have to squeeze sideways between my chair and the person sitting behind me to get through) and background noise is pretty loud (to the point where I have to lean in for the person across me to hear me), not what I expected from a fine dinning restaurant with a Michelin star. There are many restaurants that serve the same quality food, and have better service and ambiance.
The food in general were pretty good, here's a quick rating for the food I order/ try.

Great service, very proper, well dressed, we were taken care
of
the whole night. However, halfway through the the dinner, we had two men get seated next to us on the the left. Tables are tight quarters already and they must be regulars as members
of
the staff came out to talk to them quite a bit. Many times, I had a member
of
the staff squeezed so tight up next to my table with his back turned to speak these guys. I felt uncomfortable as they are loud and our sense our special dinner was sort
of
taken away.
Would I come back again? I'm willing to give them another try. Was I full off
of
the main courses? No-I had 2 small scallops and 2 small lobster tails. Boyfriend had the
beef
and we shared the cake. I was filled up off

filet

beef
with potato gnocchi.  My boyfriend had the (1) Coconut Thai curry with shrimp, calamari, lobster, scallops, and mushrooms, (2)
filet

beef
, and (3) creme fraiche cheesecake.  We had two drinks each and the bill with tip, taxes, and whatever else CA and SF add ended up around $350.  So know what you're getting into before you go so that you don't have a horrible surprise when you leave!
I like that you can customize your 3, 4, or 5 courses - choosing from any section
of
the menu.  Meaning, you could get 4 options from the dessert section or 3
filets
of
beef
if you so choose.  I'm not a dessert person and was thrilled to not be forced to have that as a course as so many other places do.  They will modify the portion sizing depending on what you are ordering.  So if you get two appetizers and a
filet
, the
filet
will be larger in size than if you were to get two other meat options with the
filet
.
In my opinion, the gnocchi was the best thing I tasted.  I would have preferred all gnocchi and no
filet
!  The steak was okay.  My boyfriend who is not as into food as I am raved about the cheesecake and actually called his meal ""out
of
this world.""  A phrase I don't believe I've ever heard him utter.
We were happy with the portion sizes - its not like the commercial
of
the couple who go to the fancy restaurant and have to stop at the convenience store on the way home to get more food.  But, considering you're paying $30 for each course, you should be full!
Nice touch to send everyone home with a wonderful pineapple sponge cake for the next day.  Delicious!!

The food here is solid and French - great ingredients transformed into dishes that are perfectly executed. I chose 5 items - surf (oysters with caviar, branzini), turf (
seared
foie,
filet
of
beef
) and the perfect dessert (lemon soufflé cake) with mignardises.  At the end
of
the meal, they gave me a small cake to take home.  I really appreciate the variety and number
of
items in their menu (I'm a little tired

set tasting menus at the moment).  I also like that this restaurant gives you a lot
of
bread (yes - I used it to soak up lots
of
the sauces).
Tom, the bartender, was the perfect host for my meal. He did a fantastic and fun job making non-alcoholic pairings for me.  Hospitality was excellent.
As for the ambiance, it's very old San Francisco (probably time for a remodel and the place is a bit dark) and feels very dated when compared to the other Michelin-starred restaurants in SF.
I would highly recommend this place for anyone looking for fine dining who is visiting Fisherman's Wharf.  The attire is business casual (dark jeans ok) but I saw a really good range
of
clothing when I visited, particularly from tourists who look like they just finished a whole day
of
sight-seeing in SF.  I look forward to my next visit to try the other items on the enormous menu."

My boyfriend and I made a last minute attempt to get reservations for our anniversary and were lucky enough to snag a table around 9pm on a weekday night only days in advance.
We arrived a little early and were invited to wait at the bar in the meantime, though we opted not to as the bar area was quite packed that night. Speaking
of
packed, the restaurant isn't all that large from what I could tell and so the volume is pretty high, just a fair warning.
I honestly don't pay too much attention to service and so I'm just going to skip that and go right into the menu and the food.
I really loved the structure
of
the menu as it allowed my boyfriend and I to try a great variety. You don't have to choose one appetizer, one main, one dessert, etc. If you want to choose all meats? Go ahead! If you have an uncontrollable sweet tooth and want to order just desserts? By all means go for it!!
My boyfriend and I each chose a 3 course meal and our selections were oysters,
seared
foie gras, lobster, duck, quail, &
filet
of
beef
(we went the meat, meat, and more meat route).
The oysters were wonderfully sweet with a beautiful pop
of
flavor from the caviar. The foie gras was by far my favorite and was not only wonderfully rich, but quite largely portioned as well (though not large enough to share with a ravenous boyfriend, I would probably order two
of
these next time!!). The lobster was flavorful and had an almost buttery texture to it that we really enjoyed (this plate would end up being my least favorite though, because I just felt like the other things on the plate didn't really complement the lobster). All the meats were incredibly tender and paired well with their accompaniments, especially the quail, and all three were fairly large portions.
At the end
of
the meal, we were treated with an extremely rich chocolate dessert as we were celebrating our anniversary and were also given a small plate
of
sweets as well as a parting gift (a delicious pumpkin and cream cheese muffin).
All in all, we really enjoyed our meal and would gladly come again!!"

Well kids they definitely sweep them off here! Gary Danko happened to be at the top
of
my list on my recent foodie trip to SF. I have heard
of
people making reservations months in advance with some only getting a 9:30pm time slot. However, luck was on my side when the concierge at the Ritz Carlton scored me a reservation same day with a 6pm time slot!!! I wanted my kids to experience their first Michelin star restaurant so I couldn't be more thrilled! We arrived much earlier than our reservation but they took us anyway. We had a nice table at the main dining area where the bar is. I would say the tables are close but not so close you can hear the conversations nearby. The ordering system is pretty simple. You can pick any 3/4/5 items from the menu. You have the freedom to choose anything you want....if you want 5 desserts or even 5 steaks you can order just that! My two cents- order mainly fish/meats and skip the desserts. They will give you a free sampler
of
mini desserts at the end and a complimentary one you are celebrating a special occasion. They also give everyone a free small soup. Just things to keep in mind before ordering.
Here are the items I ordered:
Seared
Foie Gras with Caramelized Onions and Apples- I have never tried duck liver before. To me it just tasted like a super buttery piece
of
fat. It wasn't exciting.
Pan
Seared
Bass with Israeli Couscous, Broccoli, Glazed Turnips and Radish- If bass is on the menu I will always order it. However this one was a bit more stiff to my liking. I prefer the bass that is delicate and melts in your mouth. Nonetheless it was still good.
Seared
Filet
of
Beef
with Potato Gnocchi Olive Oil, Swiss Chard and Stilton Butter- I ordered this for my kids as they love steak. They enjoyed it but it isn't something I would have ordered.
Herb Crusted Loin
of
Lamb with Farrotto, Medjool Dates, Rainbow Carrots and Green Chermoula- My favorite dish
of
the evening! The lamb was deliciously tender and moist. The dates added a bit
of
sweetness.
With over 50 items on the menu it was tough picking just 4! I am looking forward to coming back to try different items on the menu. This is one
of
the more reasonably priced Michelin star restaurants I have dined at. If you don't order alcohol you can easily have an affordable nice dining experience here. Service is perfect as expected. You have about 4-5 people waiting on your every move. When you leave to use the restroom your napkin has magically been folded and hanging on your chair when you return. They even provide purse holders for the ladies. Do not forget to take home the muffins they give you at end. Seriously the best you will ever have! Tasted perfect with my morning coffee!

Pretty difficult to find parking as you can expect. It was super cold that evening and we were lucky enough to snag a parking spot only a block and a half away. They offer valet service for $20 if you aren't lucky with parking.
The restaurant's exterior wasn't what I had imagined for some reason. You couldn't see anything in the restaurant as all the windows were tinted black. We were in for a surprise, but a wonderful one. It was very elegant inside. We came a few minutes past our reservation time as we made a quick pit stop to Patagonia a block away. Our reservation time was 5:30 which was when they opened. I was surprised to see so many people sitting down already. That was fast.
You have the option
of
choosing the tasting menu or a 3-4-5 course meal. We went for the 4-course meal. What I loved about this option was that even though you were given the option
of
appetizers, seafood, meats, and desserts, you could choose four
of
ANYTHING. It doesn't necessarily have to go in what you'd think as the proper sequence (appetizer, entree, dessert), although you could do it that way if you wanted to. It could be four entrees... all lobster if you wanted! I skipped out on the appetizers and went straight to the entrees, heh.
Originally I had ordered four entrees, BUT when I got to my third course, I started getting a bit full. Luckily, they were still able to change my fourth course into a dessert rather than the
seared
filet
of
beef
I had ordered. The waiter recommended getting a dessert when I was placing my initial order as my fourth course since it was my first time, but I definitely overestimated my appetite and turned down the dessert option. He knew all along, ha. Anyways - what I had ordered was the roast maine lobster,
seared
sea scallops, lemon pepper duck breast, and the chocolate souffle with two sauces. I think my top two favorites were the scallops and the duck breast. Both were so tender. Although the lobster was good (such a drastic change from the horrible overcooked lobster I had at that buffet in Reno omg), lobster never seems to wow me just because I've never been a huge fan
of
it. My boyfriend order the roast maine lobster, coconut thai curry with an assortment
of
seafood, herb crusted loin
of
lamb, and the duck breast as well. His coconut thai curry tasted more like a bisque than it did curry, but was still very good. I definitely wouldn't have ordered dessert as my fourth course if I knew we were going to be served an assortment
of
tiny desserts along with the free birthday dessert for my boyfriend.
At the end
of
our meal, we were given these nicely packaged desserts to take home with us. They were banana cream cheese cakes I believe!
Honestly, I would have been content with a 3-course meal.. it was too much food for one night! I guess it really depends on what you order and how hungry you really are.
Food was great, definitely super filling if you order the right things. Service was top notch. That's the one thing that stood out the most for me. Water was refilled almost instantly. And so was the bread. I found it kind
of
funny that my bread was refilled within a second
of
grabbing my final piece. They were so on top
of
everything, I loved it!
Definitely a great place to celebrate a special occasion!"

Lamb with Farrotto, Medjool Dates, Rainbow Carrots and Green Chermoula
Dessert:
- Baked Chocolate Soufflé with Two Sauces
We enjoyed every bite
of
our food! The food was cooked perfectly and had nice presentations to them. After we finished our food, they gave us a plate
of
little yummy treats. Since it was my birthday, they also gave a complimentary dessert. I think it was lemon cake, not too sure but it was good! After that, we got another complimentary thing which was banana cream cheese bread to eat for breakfast.
Everything was great, we will definitely be back! Try this place out if you haven't yet. Definitely worth it! Don't forget to make a reservation in advance!"

Me and my bf did the 5 course meal, cause we were thinking if this place is super expensive and we don't get to go here often, why not go all out and try everything. Most people would probably do fine with the 4 courses, as me and my bf were both really full by the end and we do eat a lot. Before I forget valet parking is $20 but you can definitely find street parking nearby (although it may be a limit
of
2 hours)
In terms
of
menu items:
Seared
foie gras with carmelized onions and apples - 10/10!!!!
omg this was the tastiest thing I have ever eaten in my life. the foie gras was super delectable and soft and filled with lots
of
flavor. It was small, but it was definitely one
of
my top choices after trying the other things I picked
Risotto with rock shrimp - 6.5/10
I'm not sure if I'm a fan
of
risotto, I may not be as I thought this was a little salty. My bf however thought it was really really good!
Seared
scallops - 10/10!!
These scallops tasted so good and was super soft with every bite. I felt like I was eating a meal from hells kitchen LOL. There was also this thing in the middle that I couldn't tell what it was, some sort
of
potato cake? It was super good too. I couldn't exaclty figure out the flavors but this was both one
of
me and my bf's favorite dish. definitely recommend this one if you're going here.
Horseradish crusted salmon medallion with dilled cucumbers and mustard sauce - 8/10
The salmon was super soft and not fully cooked, which was good cause it wasn't dry like other salmons  you would have at other restaurants. I like dill so I automatically enjoyed this dish, and the mustard sauce was tangy and gave you a kick too. I enjoyed the scallops more though.
Roasted Quail with stuffed mushroom and pumpkin orzo - 10/10!!!
This was probably my favorite dish out
of
the whole night! I thought the quail would be too much work but it wasn't and the stuffing in there was super tasty! the quail itself was sweet and nicely roasted as well. the pumpkin orzo was a good addition too. this is the other dish i would definitely recommend getting here!!
Lemon Pepper duck breast with pears - 9/10
The duck itself was good but it was paired with some sort
of
crabcake which kind
of
confused me and my bf cause it felt like it didn't go together, but it was nice that they included it anyway LOL. and the pears were pretty good too and they had some sort
of
fried fats on the side which went well with the dish. I think if the crabcake didn't throw me off I would have given this a 10/10 though.
Herb crusted loin
of
lamb with dates - 10/10
This was a lot better than i was thinking! I don't like lamb much but this dish didn't taste too gamey or anything, and the stuff underneath it was good too! another one i would recommend that you have to try when you come here.
Seared
Filet
of
beef
with gnocci - 6/10
Both me and my bf didn't really enjoy this too much, but i think its cause we realized we don't like
filet
. it was nicely cooked but i think the cut was just too thick for us so at one point it was just like eating raw meat. the potato gnocci was good but that's about it.
Flambeed pineapple with olive oil and rosemary cake  10/10
this dessert was definitely exotic and you get a show right in front
of
you! it's an extra $6 but definitely worth it.
Grand marnier souffle - 6/10
this didn't impress me and I guess it just felt like too much egg white? or maybe I just never had a graasp on what souffle was but both me and my bf did not enjoy this as much LOL so i would recommend the other desserts.
Espresso Martini - 8/10
This was definitely a unique drink that I recommend if you are going to get a drink! ive never seen it anywhere else and it literally was a mix
of
both espresso and martini.
Besides the food, even though I didn't think every dish was 10/10, service was very good and the whole restaurant was super sophisticated and there were some amazing dishes, and  that was enough for me to give 5/5 on our whole experience. our total bill with tip and tap ended up being around $400 but that was mainly bc we got 3 drinks and got the 5 course. definitely will come back here one day when i have a real job!
OVERALL: get the
seared
scallops, roasted quail, foie gras, herb crusted lamb, and flambeed pineapple!"

I have been here four or five times over the last few years for special occasions and it is worth every penny. If you are looking for fine dining but actually want to recognize what the dishes on the menu are, this place is for you.
The first time we came, we did 5 courses each. We left and we're absolutely stuffed (like barely breathing), so ever since we've opted for four.
I'll start with the service:
First off, I'm a sucker for bread and
butter
and love any restaurant that comes and refills my bread plate when they see it's empty.
Secondly, when you get up and go to the bathroom, they come and put a cover over your food so it stays
warm
. If that's not great service then I don't know what is.
Lastly, the staff is incredibly friendly, taking the time to answer questions and check in throughout the meal. When I dine there I truly feel like I am treated like royalty, which is nice when you're dropping a lot of money.
Then there's the food. I could go on and on but instead I'll share my dishes from my most recent visit:
Appetizer- the risotto. I'm not sure if this changes with the seasons because I typically go in July every year, but it usually has rock shrimp, crab and vegetables in it and is delightful.
Fish: roast main lobster with potato purée. Hands down my favorite dish with the exception of dessert, which we'll get to soon.
Meat: seared filet of beef. Good steak. Probably my least favorite of the bunch but not because it's not good, the other dishes are just spectacular.
Cheese: they roll out a cart and let you select a few.
Dessert:
warm
Louisiana
butter
cake
. This is no joke. My boyfriend and I literally talk about this more often than people should. Hands down the best dessert I've ever had in my life. I would pay $50 for this alone.
When you leave, they give you a treat to go, which is a nice touch. Overall, you'll spend a lot of money but it is so worth it."

The service, the food, the ambiance, everything was nothing short of amazing. Even if I wanted to I couldn't think of one negative thing to say. From the second we walked in we were treated like royalty. I couldn't imagine a better place to celebrate my birthday.
My husband ordered the seared ahi tuna, the pork tenderloin, a selection of cheeses and the
Louisiana
butter
cake
. All delicious according to him, I wouldn't know because he ate it all before I could steal a bite! Good sign...
I myself had the corn soup, beef filet, and treated myself to two desserts (hey, I'm pregnant what else is a girl to do??). The trio of creme brûlée was great. The proverbial cherry on top however were the flambéed cherries on tres leches
cake
, pun intended. The whole restaurant stopped eating to enjoy the show, when our waiter brought over a special grill cart to flambé the cherries right at our table.
Yes, this place is definitely pricy. Is it worth it however? Every last penny if you ask me."

What really made the evening memorable, as much as the food, was the care and attention given to our service. Yes the food was amazing, but you already knew that. We had oysters with caviar, lobster, duck, bison, quail, scallops, soft-shell crab, risotto, bronzini, Thai seafood curry, lemon semifreddo and
Louisiana
butter
cake
. Each dish was spectacular, unique, perfectly prepared and presented. The only disappointment was the signature chocolate soufflé with two sauces which was a little soupy.
We had called a few days before or reservation and let the restaurant know that we were celebrating our daughter's college graduation. Not only did they write a congratulatory message on the semifreddo  plate and put a candle in it, they went so far as to print a personalized menu with a the occasion on it. So sweet and amazing. The whole experience was a ""10"". Our server Jared was amazingly attentive, friendly and informative as was every person who provided service to our table. In a town of hipster restaurants, some quite excellent, it is refreshing to dine at a restaurant where the dining experience is as important as the food. Thank you Gary Danko for making our special evening truly special!"

It has been on my list of places to try for ten years. It doesn't look like the menu has changed much either as it stays true to classic French technique. We came to celebrate mother's day with my family and while there were some highs and lows, I'm glad I finally got to try it.
The menu concept is interesting as you can choose between 3-, 4-, and 5-course tasting menus. The interesting part is that you could choose whatever you want, including all appetizers, all desserts, or even all main entrees. One of the low points was our experience with the sommelier, who seemed to look down on us when we ordered a half bottle of wine between three people (we don't drink much). Although his eventual recommended wine was good, we didn't appreciate his judgmental attitude.
As for the food, we started with appetizers including the risotto with rock shrimp, Dungeness crab, asparagus, and beech mushrooms. While the risotto was good, the flavors were very one-note, but loved the shrimp and crab. The salt cured foie gras torchon with Meyer lemon jam, charred baby leeks, smoked almonds and country bread was my favorite. The foie gras was so rich and creamy, and was the perfect complement to the toast. For mains, the roast Maine lobster is a signature dish that is a must-try. It's both elegant and a classic. For my last entree, I tried the juniper crusted bison, which surprisingly wasn't gamey at all. I also tried a taste of the seared filet of beef, which was cooked perfectly. The roasted quail stuffed with mushrooms was also a great dish.
We skipped the cheese course and tried a couple desserts including the trio of creme brulee with assorted cookies, and the recommended
warm
Louisiana
butter
cake
. As with many fine dining restaurants, I wasn't as impressed by the dessert. The
butter
cake
wasn't as moist as the one I've had at Maestro's and the creme brulee, while good, didn't have my favorite flavors.
The night ended with us receiving a pineapple cheesecake for the next day and a rose for the women for mother's day, which was a nice touch. The ambiance was romantic enough for a nice date, but also fits for family gatherings. With so many consistent years of food and service, it's no wonder it has retained its one star Michelin."

SERVICE-
Great service, very proper, well dressed, we were taken care of the whole night. However, halfway through the the dinner, we had two men get seated next to us on the the left. Tables are tight quarters already and they must be regulars as members of the staff came out to talk to them quite a bit. Many times, I had a member of the staff squeezed so tight up next to my table with his back turned to speak these guys. I felt uncomfortable as they are loud and our sense our special dinner was sort of taken away.
Would I come back again? I'm willing to give them another try. Was I full off of the main courses? No-I had 2 small scallops and 2 small lobster tails. Boyfriend had the beef and we shared the
cake
. I was filled up off of the
butter

, dessert platter and chocolate birthday

Louisiana
butter
cake
- and my wife's courses - poached farm egg with sweetbreads; lobster; duck breast; cheese plate; and peanut

The only issue with the staff I had was at times they would reach over me in an awkward way.
The food was really good but what blew me away was the portion size. I'm used to tasting menus being small items, just a few bites. For instance I ordered the horseradish encrusted salmon medallion. Seeing medallion I was expecting a very small bite or two. When it arrived it was a significant piece of meat.
We also had the filet, risotto, cheese selection, and

I opted to have our waitress choose the cheeses for me and she brought everything I love, it was fantastic. My only regret was I ate too much and was so full I couldn't finish the cheese.

It was packed when we arrived. Parking wasn't too bad for us luckily. We found meter parking by Ghirardelli. We got here around 9pm, the doorman opened the door for us and here we were at Gary Danko. The hostess took my coat and told us to wait by the bar since our table wasn't ready yet. My boyfriend and I ordered non alcoholic drink and they were tasty. I can't remember what they were but my boyfriend's drink had some sparkling orange drink and I had some lemon daiquiri. It was around 9:30 and the host came to get us and told us the table was ready. We were seated and gave us the menu. The waiter was super attentive, nice, funny and handsome!  My bf and I had the 4 course meal. It was around $101 per person and it was worth it.

Lobster was on point and juicy. The meat just came right off the shell. Pork belly was chewy and tasty. The trio creme brulee was perfect and it came with 3 different cookies. Service was GREAT. The waiter came by to check on us every so often. Can't forget about the water guy. He came around refilling our water plenty of times lol which was nice. Everyone who works here was super nice and caring. At the end, when our desserts came out, the waiter came back again and gave us a chocolate
cake
with some small sweets. It was such a lovely gesture and they even wrote Happy Anniversary on the plate. I didn't think they would actually treat us by doing all this even though I wrote on the note section when making the reservation that we were celebrating our anniversary but didn't expect this!!

Dinner was excellent & service was exquisite. Though some ingredients have changed, the classic menu remains fundamentally unchanged.
It can be difficult getting a reservation. You can't make a reservation on Opentable. You must call or email, & get a confirmation number. Reservations cannot be made more than two months in advance. Needless to say, plan ahead.
We had reservations, but somehow the hostess had us down for a different time. Mistakes happen, but it seemed like she thought we were at fault. I guess it's always best to confirm reservations a day prior to showing up to the restaurant. No matter, we were seated not too long afterwards.
The restaurant is rather dark & cozy. A little too cozy as we audibly heard a neighboring diner who made chide remarks about our all-black attire. It was actually really funny overhearing this. What can I say? We didn't plan our outfits very well.
For the rest of the evening, service was amazing. The servers really make you feel taken care of here. Overall, I give Gary Danko a 9/10, w/ the exception of the reservation discrepancy.

For the most bang for your buck, I encourage you to get 5 steaks for $119.
APPETIZERS
Seared Foie Gras w/ Caramelized Onions & Apples:
Seared to a golden brown & melts in your mouth like
butter
. It's like eating straight up fat, but oh-so-good anyway. The caramelized onions & apples add sweet & tart flavors to cut through the heavy richness of the foie gras.
Crispy Farm Egg w/ Grits, Royal Trumpet Mushrooms, Frisee:
Who doesn't love a poached egg? Got the image in your head? Now take that poached egg, bread it, fry it, & serve it over some greens. I always find it so satisfying to break into runny egg yolk. A little egg yolk over frisee actually makes a pretty nice dressing.
Risotto w/Lobster, Gulf Shrimp, Shimeji Mushrooms & Butternut Squash:
Creamy w/ big chunks of lobster & shrimp spread throughout. The consistency of the rice was a little more broken up than I am used to for risotto.
SEAFOOD
Roast Maine Lobster w/ Potato Puree, Black Trumpet Mushrooms, Corn & Tarragon:
Chunks of claw meat resting in the shell, adorned w/ a sprig of tarragon that looks like it's growing out of the lobster.
Seared Tuna w/ Peppers & Onions:
Mildly flavored strips of tuna over a light sauce. It was an interesting combination, but not the most memorable tuna I've had.
MEAT
Seared Filet of Beef w/ Cremini Mushrooms, Braised Shallots & Potato
Cake
:
Beautifully petite filet cooked to a pink-in-the-center medium rare over a sweet & savory sauce, accompanied w/a breaded & fried potato
cake
.
The current beef filet comes with a rich & creamy square of potato gratin.
Roast Quail Stuffed w/ Mushroom Ragout, Leeks, Quinoa, Foie Gras, on Ham Hocks & Maitake w/ Corn
Cake
:
One of the better quail dishes I've had. Quail tends to be dry, but the stuffing enhances the flavors & juices of the bird. The corn
cake
was topped w/ corn salsa.
DESSERT
Baked Chocolate Souffle w/ 2 Sauces:
It was beautifully presented. The server poured the the chocolate & custard sauces into the center of the souffle w/ ease. I wish I had captured a photo prior to the sauces being applied to the souffle. The texture was light, yet creamy, but the tasted so rich.
Warm
Louisiana

sounded too interesting, but it was still delicious w/ baked apple slices on top for fruity sweetness. The huckleberry compote added some acidity to the overall rich & buttery dessert.
Complimentary Dessert Assortment - little tea cookies, brownies, fruit jellies & things
As if we didn't already consume enough dessert, we were also presented w/ a little cheesecake topped w/ raspberry & a single elongated candle to celebrate our special occasion.
Last but not least, we were given their signature complimentary takeout dessert, which I believe is a souffle, but I'm not sure - I never got to open it.
Had I known we were going to be consuming so many sweet desserts, I might have gone w/ the artisanal cheeses presented tableside. The dishes that really stood out to me were the crispy farm egg, lobster risotto, & chocolate souffle. If I came back, I'd definitely like to try the oysters w/ caviar.
Though pricey, I would say Gary Danko's prices pale in comparison to many other fine dining establishments. It is a wonderful restaurant to dip your toes into the fine dining pool."

We came here 2/13 at 9:30 for our 10pm reservation & did valet parking for $15+tip. Upon entering, we were greeted by the host, checked in, and waited about 5 minutes until someone else came and took us to our table.
We were asked if we wanted a wine or cocktail list & served our choice of water. One of the waiters came by and served us some bread (we got unlimited bread without having to ask until our plates were taken away). We ordered 2 Moscow mules which were delicious!! It was probably one of the best I've ever had- and I order them everywhere I go.
So, how it works here is you are given the choice to order a 3,4, or 5 course meal. We originally were going to do the 5 course meal which was an appetizer, a meat course, seafood course, cheese plate, and dessert, but we got too stuffed mid meal so our server took the cheese course off our meal! To start, I ordered the seared foie gras which was amazing. It was perfectly buttery and the sauce that went along with it was perfect and did not overpower the dish. Next, I had the coconut Thai curry which came with scallops, shrimp, lobster, and calamari over a bed of rice. All of the seafood were cooked to perfection and I liked how they gave you less rice and more seafood. Thumbs up to that! AND! The scallops were big and not those little skimpy ones. Moving forward, I had the filet of beef which came with some potatoes. The filet came cooked to perfection-medium rare. Most times when I ask for medium rare, my steak is still mooing. Hello.... I don't want to eat a live cow on my plate!  Lastly, we finished off with our dessert. I had the
Louisiana
butter
cake
& my boyfriend had the cheesecake and they were both AMAZING! Not too sweet and the ice cream that came with it paired very well. I will definitely be back. Awesome food, awesome service."

And while I could fill pages with how wonderful the service, atmosphere, and drinks are, I think I'll just stick with my favorites from the food.
Seared Foie Gras: If you're into foie gras, you cannot go wrong with this. You're given way more foie gras then you would get anywhere else.
Seared Sea Scallops: These may be the best scallops I've ever had. Yes, you only get a few, but you'll savor every last bite with your eyes closed.
Lemon Pepper Duck Breast: You get a large portion of duck, and it's served with this incredible duck hash as well. For true duck lovers, this is a must have.
Herb Crusted Loin of Lamb: This is a ridiculous, decadent dream. The lamb is so tender and flavorful.

Seared Ahi Tuna
Pan Seared Bass
Horseradish Salmon
Lamb
Seared Filet of Beef
cheese plate
Creme Brulee
Warm
Louisiana
Buttercake
They were all delicious.  The winners were (by far) the salmon, the lamb, and the buttercake for dessert.  Everything was good, but these three were outstanding.  If I were to visit again I'd probably scrap the cheese.  It wasn't bad, but I'd opt for an appetizer instead.
On top of that - because it was an anniversary celebration, they brought out an additional dessert and tray of cookies.  Everything was so very good!  Initially with the small portion size I was worried we wouldn't be full, but by the end of it, were were overly stuffed.
They sent us home with pumpkin cheesecake for breakfast.
The only critique I have is the awkwardness of everybody celebrating something and getting the same dessert.  Seemed a bit impersonal and staged, particularly if you're the third group in your section to get the ""Congratulations"" and here you go.  Not complaining about the free dessert though :D."

This place has been on my list of places to eat at for FOREVER. So, on my birthday, we had no plans, and I decided that it was time to make reservations. I did call about 2 months before my birthday for reservations and at the time, they had only two spots available - 5:30 or 9. 5:30 it is! When we arrived, we were immediately seated at a little table for two that was small, but a good size for me and my hubby. The restaurant is dimly lit which leads to a more quiet, somewhat romantic, and very calm atmosphere. It was really quite lovely. The waiter told us a little about the menu and took our drink order. The wait staff there are all very professional and courteous. Definitely a plus for a nice restaurant such as this. My husband and I decided to do 4 courses. For my appetizer, I did the Dungeness crab and melon salad. My husband had the corn soup with biscuit. The salad was delicious. The crab tasted fresh and was complimented so well by the melon. My husband's soup was definitely very good. I tried some and it was light but flavorful, and the biscuit floating in the soup soaking up the flavors was perfect to bite into while eating the soup. Next was our fish plate. I had the sea scallops and my husband had the soft shell crab. Both were, also, very good. However, the sea scallops are literally two scallops with some sauce. While the soft shell crab is a full soft shell crab, with pureed potatoes, and an assortment of vegetables. So, the soft shell crab is more bang for your buck. I love scallops, but that soft shell crab was a better plate in my opinion. Then, came our meat plate. I had the pork tenderloin with braised cheek, and my husband had the lamb. We both agreed that our entrees were decent, but not amazing. After our appetizer and fish plate, we were enthusiastically awaiting our entrees. And instead of our overall meal being elevated, it just plateaued, which was a disappointment. Don't misunderstand, the meal was good, but the flavors weren't as awesome as our first two plates. For my husband's fourth course, he chose the cheese platter. We chose four cheeses - a gruyere, a brie, and two goat cheeses that names escape me right now. Some of the cheeses were rich and creamy, some were hard and crumbly, but all were full of flavor and wonderful. We enjoyed choosing our cheeses as well as eating them! My last course was dessert and I chose the
warm
Louisiana
butter
bread with peaches and vanilla ice cream. Very good. The only thing about dessert is that after dessert they bring you some small dessert bites, that you possibly don't have any room for, but somehow end up sampling anyways! So, my suggestion would be to go for a lighter dessert, so you can enjoy the small bites, as well. And of course, they sent us home with some pineapple cream cheese
cake
(which we ate the next day with our kid and she loved it!). Overall, 4 stars. Could have been 5 stars, but the entrees didn't quite meet our expectations."

Highlights of our dinner were the pan roasted quail stuffed with cornbread and pancetta, the seared sea scallops, and the pork tenderloin.  The preparation was meticulous, but on the salty side for our tastes.  In retrospect, I think that if we had mentioned to our attentive waiters that we preferred lower sodium in our meals, that request would have been honored.
Our strawberry souffle and

You put your name on the whiteboard and make sure you stand near the door because the guy calling out the names can have fatigue so you barely hear your name being called.
We finally got seated after a 30 minute wait. Their menu is extensive - but all you need to remember from all the people raving on yelp is the Dry Fry Chicken (wet).

Dry Fry Chicken (wet) diced: This came with a spicy and sweet sauce that was a nice contrast to the perfectly fried chicken. Crunchy, spicy and sweet and oh so good.
Shrimp

Black Bean Sauce Noodles (sliced beef,
shrimp

So this place gets ridiculously crowded for dinner time (I've driven past the crowds on the way home) but at lunch actually it wasn't too bad. There was about a 5 min wait while they cleared out a table for our party of two. The place is fairly spacious with lots of room for big parties but they also have some four tops for those that are traveling lighter.
We ordered the fried chicken, potstickers (on the recommendation of a coworker and fellow yelpers), honey walnut

shrimp
is probably pretty standard and I've had better

They have lunch specials and the lunch special fried chicken was 6pcs as opposed to 12. They are served wet or dry and I thought we ordered ours dry but they came with a sauce on it.. which I would think would be the wet ones? Either way they were still super good.

I went yesterday on a Friday night for dinner and the wait was surprisingly short. At around 7pm, there were only 3 people in front of me on the list. This translated to only a 15 minute wait. Oftentimes when I would pass by the restaurant, I would notice a crowd so large that it would've had to be at least an hour wait.
I've been coming here for the last 10 years with my family before San Tung became very well known to the Bay Area community. Still to this day, I order the same things: chicken wings, string beans,
shrimp
and
leek
dumplings
, deluxe noodle.
Although everything about my meal was delicious, I noticed compared to before, portions are smaller and everything is a lot sweeter- especially the string beans and chicken wings. The string beans and the chicken wings used to actually have a mild spiciness level, but you don't get that anymore."

Despite there being 20 people ahead of us when we arrived, the wait went by very fast which was a plus.  But take note: you only get one chance to be seated once if your name gets called off the wait list, they don't mess around with seating you quickly. So if you don't hear your name called, you are out of luck.
We ordered their famous chicken, but we asked for it diced instead of on the bone (disappointing... To me the chicken tasted like a less syrupy version of Panda Express orange chicken), we also ordered a peanut sauce noodle (which was amazing, the sauce was rich and well seasoned and the noodles were perfectly cooked in my opinion), we also ordered their Green Beans (which was also decent. It wasn't as seasoned or oily as other Chinese Green Beans I've eaten, which was a good thing) we also got
shrimp
and
leek
dumplings
(the cooks forgot about our
dumplings
and we didn't receive them until after they gave us our bill to leave; we had to remind them we ordered it and when we finally did get them, they were tough, over done, and I feel they had too much
leek

dumplings
)
Overall San Tungs was an OKAY dining experience. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again."

All around they are very much as one would expect a Chinese Restaurant to be - nothing special, but solid American style Chinese food - except those chicken wings are above par.
Their Dry Fried Chicken Wings are quite good. VERY nicely fried, and the sauces is pretty tasty (although I could have gone spicier - maybe if I weren't white they would have made them spicier - who knows. ;) )
The other things? Eh. Tasted like Chinese food. We got the green beans - another Chinese dish I can sometimes handle and they were ok - but I've definitely had better. We also got fried rice - which was fine - but didn't stand out in anyway. Last we got
shrimp

We opted to pay for meter parking since parking is scarce in SF. Waiting in line in the cold, I was stoked to ry the famous wings and a few other recommended dishes-- thanks fellow Yelpers. Right at 11am, the doors opened and a full house was seated within minutes.
Pro-tip: come within that first wave of customers to avoid the wait.
We ordered the following dishes based on popular reviews:
* Dry fried chicken (3/5): these were supposed to be one of the BEST wings I will have in my life. I thought they were just slightly above average. Maybe the hype was overbuilt for these wings-- some friends will load a carry-on bag with wings to bring back to SoCal for friends as a souvenir gift from their travels 50 mins north in a plane lol I thought they were just standard wings dressed in an Asian sauce. What's so special about that? t least the wings weren't dry I suppose..
*
Shrimp
and
leek
dumplings
(2/5): these came out cold in the middle as if they froze them and didn't defrost the
dumplings
before cooking them.. not a fan but props to them for not making the
dumpling
shell to doughy.
* Black bean paste noodles (1/5): drenched in black bean paste, I wasn't sure what I was eating aside from the sauce..

The whiteboard to write your name is to your right as soon as you enter. Put your name down and wait.
The place is relatively small, so not much space but I did notice a small separate dining room for a larger party. It wasn't that long before we were seated maybe 20 minutes? I'm pretty patient so wait times don't bother me too much.
We ordered:
2 orders of the
original
dry
fried
chicken
- not sure why it's called
dry
because they are the exact opposite.
Chicken
is moist and covered in sauce. The sauce is sweet, tangy, and salty. It has some red pepper flakes in it. Reminded me of Panda Express's orange
chicken
but better. Plus they use drummettes &
wings
.  This is what they're known for and my boyfriend and I were fans! Soo good.
Szechuan roasted duck & buns: one of my fave Chinese wedding dishes which I had to introduce to my Mexican boyfriend. He fell in love! He cleaned the bones and basically ate whole thing by himself. I personally think I've had better but I'm just glad he liked it.
The
dry
black bean noodles were alright. Definitely nothing out of this world. The texture of the mushy noodles kind of grossed me out.
Overall I give this place 3.5 stars rounding to 4. The
chicken
alone made up for the lack of customer service. The servers were disgruntled and some of the plates and tea cups were dirty. Overall I had a great time and we took home leftovers."

The wait is usually pretty long for the weekend. I'd say anywhere between an hour to two. If you go about 20 min prior to when they open for dinner you'll be able to be seated right away. I saw a large group walk in at opening saying they had reservations but I'm guessing they only take reservations for large parties.
Recently we ordered the
original
dry
fried
chicken
, the pork and leek dumplings, the hot and sour soup, the garlic green beans, and the black bean sauce noodles. The
original
dry
fried
chicken
is great because it has a bit of spice yet a bit of sweetness to it. I wouldn't call it
dry
exactly though since there is sauce but it's more of a sticky sauce rather than something like buffalo
wings
. The pork and leek dumplings weren't so impressive to me since I felt they were bland and super salty on the inside. I enjoyed the black bean sauce noodles and the garlic green beans. Though I did like the hot and sour soup I did notice it tasted very spicy due to a peppery taste? It was as if they used a lot of the grey pepper you see in Asian restaurants so if you're not into that and a kick of spice then this dish might not be for your.
Portions are fair for the cost. Service can be so so as you'd have to wave down the waiters from time to time and maybe multiple times before they catch your attention. I'd come back but if the wait is too long I'd rather usually just take it to go

Five Spice Beef Noodle (#14 sliced five spice beef and tendon in a bowl of fresh homemade soup noodles accompanied with spinach, $12): This was the first beef noodle soup I had with broth that contains pieces of ginger, but broth had an interesting aroma and tasted slightly spicy.

chicken
wings
and green beans with high praise. But I never really had the desire to try it, because its just Asian food... But one day, I happened to be in the area and decided to give it a try. And since then, I've been making San Tung a regular stop whenever I'm in SF, and introducing it to all my friends.
My first time here, I came on a Saturday night, during prime time. It was about a 40 minute wait for 2 people. Once seated, we ordered the

The

was hands down, the best Asian
fried
chicken
I've ever had. The
wings
were cooked perfectly, bursting with flavor. Each order comes with about 9-10
wings
. The sauce goes great on top of white rice too! The string beans were really good too. It complimented the
chicken
. The chow mein was a it too oily, but still delicious. The potstickers were massive. I recommend sharing the plate of 6 with 6 people... My top two favorite things were the
wings
and green beans, definitely a must try.
The customer service here was okay. They are very busy so sometimes its hard to get the server's attention. The atmosphere of the restaurant itself resembles any other Chinese family restaurant.
The parking situation here is very bad though. Located in a very popular area, its hard to come across street parking. I had to circle around for 20 minutes before finding something.
Overall, I highly recommend giving this place a try. Its a good place to go with a bigger group of people, that way, you can do family style meal.

Wings
. The Sautéed String Beans were crispy and delicious. It was sautéed in this flavorful garlic sauce. Definitely a must-try. The Black Bean Sauce Noodles was a cross between the Chinese and Korean version. It was tasty, but it was my least favorite of the 3 that my friend & I ordered. Instead of just beef/pork, they added shrimp and calamari, which was weird to me. I'm not a fan of seafood in my Jajjangmyun/Zhajiangmian.
Now, let's get down to the
chicken
y'all. Let me tell ya, it was probably one of the best
chicken
wings
I've ever had. It had a savory sweet taste. These
wings
definitely made it to my overall top 5 favorites that I had to buy a box to bring home to Bae. Trying to win BGFOTY (Best GF of the Year) award nom sayin'? XD
The service wasn't so great as expected at these type of Asian restaurants. It was hard to get water refills and we always had to flag someone down. Overall, a great experience in regards to the food, which makes up for the slow service."

and rice! Each plate came with 12 pieces so order two plates 'cos you're going to want more. Well, especially if you're with a group of hungry friends. The sauce has a little kick to it but is also on the sweeter side. Be prepared for sticky fingers, too! But trust, the mess is worth every bite.
Note: It can get really packed so expect a wait. BUT! There's a San Tung 2 right next door to the

fried
chicken
I've had, hands down!
If you're in the San Francisco area, you've got to stop by here. My friend and I went here for a weekend trip to visit our other friend, who took us on an adventure full of food and fun lol.
Originally
, this place was on our agenda for lunch on Sat, but we had had brunch beforehand and it would've been too much.
We ended up coming there for dinner and made sure we were early so we could get their famous
ORIGINAL
DRY
FRIED
CHICKEN
WINGS
. We found parking luckily before the street got packed, and got in line at 4:40pm.
The line got really long quickly, and they decided to open early, letting us in at 4:53pm. Within minutes, it was a full house!!
It only took about 15 minutes for our to go order, and the three of us had 4 pieces each. Their
chicken
is one of the best, comparable to Korean
fried
chicken
but a little better. They are a little sweet but nonetheless top notch! Not sure why the
chicken
is coined
DRY
FRIED
CHICKEN
as it is not
dry
at all.
The outside of the
fried
chicken
was crispy and crunchy, with a mound of sweet thick sauce on the bottom. Not sure how the
chicken
managed to stay crunchy with all the sauce, but it did. It didn't matter either because it didn't take us long to devour the box... Gone in 60 seconds! Maybe a little more. The only thing I would do is add more sesame seeds to it.
The
chicken
was so good we ended up coming back  for a SECOND ORDER after we had dinner at another restaurant. This time around, we also tried their BLACK BEAN NOODLES (make sure you ask for black bean noodles and not the wet black bean noodles, as there are 2 items on the menu) which were delicious as well. You get a huge order for $11, and it is mostly noodles drenched in black bean sauce, with small bits of mixed seafood.
This place was so good we came back the next day with another friend from out of town! The four of us had more 2 dozen... so 4 dozen
original
dry
fried
chicken
wings
in two days!! I'm not much of a meat eater... so it goes to show how good this place is if we can consume that many
chicken
wings
in a short time lol.
I will definitely drop by here the next time I am in the area. Quick service and tasty food!
Happy eating!"

We pulled up and the sidewalk was already crowded with people waiting.  What does that tell you?  We put our names on the list and it was about an hour wait.  If you have the time, it's well worth the wait.
Once we were seated, we noticed that almost every table in the restaurant had orders of the chicken wings, and some tables have multiple plates of them. Besides ordering the chicken wings, we also had
pork
dumplings
, black bean sauce noodles and Mongolian beef. Everything we ordered was delicious but the dry chicken wings were hands-down our favorite.  Next time I would get a few orders of them.

I noticed that they have a San Tung 2 right next door and was told they open it up when the main store gets too crowded. Even though it was really busy when I went, the second store was still closed. It would have been really nice if they opened it to help out with the crowd though.
We ordered the string beans,

We ordered 2 plates of the fried chicken, one plate of
pork
dumplings
, the string beans, and the black bean noodles. Everyone comes here for the fried chicken, and for good reason! I am completely in love with the sweet/salty, sticky sauce that the wings come drenched in. The wings are perfectly crispy and not soggy from the sauce at all! Green beans were good. You can either drench them in the sauce they come in or dip them in the chicken wing sauce. Otherwise, there's not too much flavor to them.
Dumplings
were as good as
dumplings
can be. The noodles were probably my least favorite dish to the meal just because I felt that it lacked flavor and some salt. I was hoping it would satisfy my craving for zha jiang mian, but sadly it didn't.
Since we were one of the first tables to order, our food came out really fast; I'd say within 20 minutes. Even when I came during a busier time before, the food would never take long to come out. I really enjoyed this because, on both occasions, I was STARVING so was glad to receive my food quickly.
They do give you a fortune cookie at the end. However, it doesn't come in a plastic bag like most do, which makes me kind of skeptical about how clean it is. I don't know whether or not they used tongs or something to pick them up, or if they just used their hands to put it on the check holder. I wish they would've bought packaged cookies to serve to their guests just due to sanitation reasons.
I'll definitely be coming back to this place for the fried chicken time and time again. Might try some different noodles though. Will keep you updated!"

I know I'm late to the hype, but I could never get here early enough to avoid the ridiculous wait or find parking. So, I was excited when my cousins decided to meet here early for lunch. We planned to get to the restaurant before they opened at 11am and WE DID IT! That's pretty surprising since we all run on Filipino time and we were coming from different areas: SSF, San Leandro and Salinas/Monterey.
Parking was hell, but we were lucky enough to find parking in the nearby neighborhood. There was already a long line at 1045am but we were able to get seated as soon as the doors opened.
We ordered:
- the popular Dry Chicken Wings: yaaaaasss, BELIEVE THE HYPE! My friend had let me try her leftovers before and it was so good but having it fresh was just AMAZING! The crispy chicken tossed in garlic, ginger and chili flakes was worth every bite!
- Garlic Flavored Eggplant
- Dry Fried Beef
-

Dumplings
- Dry Sauteed Stringbeans
- House Fried Rice

The food is definitely good and even has the traditional Chinese vibe with a diverse crowd of locals and travelers eating here. Unfortunately, that usually results in a long line that takes a while to get seated and often after being seated another 5 - 10 minutes before a server noticed you.
I should note though, San Tungs is a fairly well oiled machine given how few staff they had on the floor. I wouldn't last more than an hour doing the work they do where they rotate around between service, cleaning and hosting. I have a lot of respect for the work they do so this review takes that effort into account.
As mentioned earlier, service is a little slow so it took roughly 10 minutes after being seated to finally be able to order. Once ordered, the food flowed out from the kitchen quite quickly. However, my group ordered a set of steamed potstickers and fried potstickers (to-go) after deciding we were still hungry. Our server told us the wait would be 15 minutes but we agreed.
Once the potstickers arrived, it made the wait just a blip in our memory. Despite not being highly sought after on Yelp, I highly recommend the steamed potstickers. They had this slightly chewier texture in comparison to the
dumplings
we ordered. The skin of the dough was more elastic than the
dumplings
and held the heat of the filling better. Truthfully, it was kind of bit similar to the
pork
dumplings
as the filling was the same but the texture of the elastic potsticker skin really made the juicy filling shine better.
Besides the potstickers, their well known dry chicken was good as usual. It felt as the wings were a bit smaller this time around but all of that was forgotten upon the first bite. One thing that San Tungs does so much better than other places for fried chicken is how they seal the moisture of the chicken within the wings while still having a crunchy skin exterior.
After finally eating our fill, we asked for the check and paid. As I've said earlier in my review, this place was understaffed for the sheer volume of customers. Well for my group, the server forgot our take out order despite ordering it alongside steamed potstickers. Since it was already paid for, we looked like idiots waiting at the table after finishing eating. I would hope they can add more staff in the future so they're not overworked but it wasn't a great experience for a meal to be pulled back another 20 minutes since they forgot to make the fried potstickers.
Ultimately, this place has great food but their service can improve mostly from having more staff on the floor. My review is mostly a reflection of the food and seeing how hard their staff was working but other patrons were visibly upset at missing orders and long periods between service.
TL;DR Food was great as always but service was mediocre at best. I'd also recommend a hidden gem, steamed potstickers over their
dumplings

We got the chicken wings,

I would recommend the dry fried chicken. This is something I would definitely come back for. It is extra hot when it comes out so be careful eating it. The sauce for this chicken is amazing! I would eat it with rice in the future
Lastly, the dried sautéed string beans. It's pretty typical to get at any Chinese restaurant. I still enjoyed it.
Overall, I give a three stars because I wasn't impressed with the popular orders. I probably wouldn't come back to eat."

We got the famous fried chicken wings - must have, so good, the honey walnut prawns - fried perfectly, so crisp and yummy with the right amount of mayo and fantastic walnuts. We also ordered their black bean noodles and eggplant. I'm not a big fan of the other two dishes, but just their chicken wings and honey walnut prawn will keep me coming back.
I've noticed some people it's Chinese food. Just want to clarify that it's not authentic food. (We don't eat dry fried chicken wings or prawns with mayo lol). But it's sooooo delicious! I haven't tried San Tung 2 but heard they share the same chef except that they don't have dumplings or

This is a must EAT place and highly recommend it! Parking here may be a hassle, have to circle around multiple times to pray for parking god. Finally found and parked at residential area and walk to the restaurant. The wait time could be long during peak hours, there's a paper hanging at the wall for Dine-in & Take-out waitlist, just write your name on there with a party number next to it. Once it's done, just hangout and wait outside. If you don't want to wait, San Tung 2 (next door) is always a lot less people waiting in line and can be seated in a shorter wait time - they don't sell
potstickers
/ dumplings. I mean there's a reason why people rather wait in a long time for this place than next door (which they supposed to serve you equivalent food fishes, ya know). You be the judge and decide where to go and eat!
This place is definitely worth my time to wait and we ordered the following amazing dishes, I swear each dish is on crack, very addicting and ridiculously delicious with loads of heavy tasting of sodium for sure, but they are sooo good.
1. Shrimp & Leek Dumpling (4/5): Im never a big fan of leek, but these dumplings are simply tasty with handmade dumpling doughy wrap with fully stuffed of meats, leek and shrimp inside. I wasn't expecting much outta this, but it turned out to be pretty good. Dumplings were kinda small but it was more like a one bite size for me and served as good appetizer. (we got too hungry and devoured these dumplings In no time right after they served to ya after the long wait time approx. 45mins-1 hr)
2.  Jjajiangmyun (3.5/5): Black bean sauce was well made and once mixed well with freshly cooked noodles, it was ready to eat. I didn't like much of the big pieces of onions (which was overpowering the overall taste), but loved the thinly slice of cucumber in there. Since this place mostly served/ we ordered mostly heavy taste foods, so comparing to other dishes, this one became kinda bland and I had to mix up with more chili spicy sauce in order to taste the food!
3. Dried Spicy Chicken Wings (5/5): they put crack on there I swear (lol), each piece of fried chicken wing was well-marinated and well mixed up with spicy, sweet and saltiness. Loved the crispy outside and mighty batters and served super hot and came right out to your table, it was super addictive and i couldn't stop eating them. My friend said even leftover re-heated up was still very surprisingly deliciousness. Can totally see why every table orders this infamous dried spicy chicken wings, couldn't agree more this is the BEST chicken wings I've ever had!
4. Stir Fried Green Beans (5/5): this was a must order if you want some ""greens"" (lol). It was salty sweet and oily dish, but better to eat some greens than nothing, right!!!
Lots of SODIUM & SUGAR & SPICY Sauce make every dish tasted so freaking delicious. I could so tell because the next day I woke up, my face and body was feeling super bloated, and my double eyelids even got disappeared and became single eyelid (lolllllll). Imagine the amount of sodium, msg and other stuffs they put in the foods, don't get me wrong! I love their foods, and it was definitely worth my trip to visit and dine in here. I will be back for sure :) Yummmmm ^^"

I really really wanted the wet fried chicken wing sauce to be outstanding. It was great and I really enjoyed the wings. These are not wimpy, scrimp-by-their-reputation sized wings. This is a full batch. So, size wise a grown man will be satisfied with one order of wings. But, the sauce was not as sweet or spicy as I wanted. The sauce fell somewhere in the middle which left me wanting more. The
potstickers
were great. I loved that the stickers were thick and breaded. The meat mixture had a nice flavor. Here again, I really wanted the excess sauce from the fried chicken to be available to dip the stickers. I did that but it just wasn't all that I hoped for.

The name ""San Tung"" translates to the word ""Shan Dong"" (a province in China) and the province is best known for its dumplings. Since the province is just one Yellow Sea away from Korea, San Tung's menu also have several Korean influenced dishes.
Our group got here 15 minutes before the opening time and the restaurant opened 5 minutes early (4:55 PM). Initially the restaurant was 50% filled up, but by the time we walked out at 6 PM the restaurant was completely packed. Food did take a while to come out (15+ minutes), but service was actually pretty good comparing with other Chinese restaurants (English friendly menu & waiters spoke good English).
***
Five Spice Beef Noodle (#14 sliced five spice beef and tendon in a bowl of fresh homemade soup noodles accompanied with spinach, $12): This was the first beef noodle soup I had with broth that contains pieces of ginger, but broth had an interesting aroma and tasted slightly spicy. Beef and tendon had 5-star worthy melt-in-your-mouth texture. Noodle was pretty mediocre. It was a good beef noodle soup, but I had better one in Southern California (e.g. SinBala Restaurant & Corner Beef Noodle House).
Original Dry Fried Chicken (#71 - chicken wings deep fried in butter with garlic, ginger, and roasted red peppers; 12 pieces of wings for $13.50): This is San Tung's #1 signature item. Each wing was covered in addicting sweet and sour sauce with slightly spicy kick. Chicken quality was pretty good too - not too dry and pretty meaty.
***
If you are a fan of KFC (not Colonel Sanders - I mean Korean fried chicken), then you will appreciate San Tung's fried chicken because these wings also had similar sweet & spicy flavor profiles. Overall a solid 4.25-star on food.
P.S. - San Tung has a sister restaurant right next door (San Tung 2), but the sister restaurant does not sell

Everyone would post pictures of their chicken wings and green beans with high praise. But I never really had the desire to try it, because its just Asian food... But one day, I happened to be in the area and decided to give it a try. And since then, I've been making San Tung a regular stop whenever I'm in SF, and introducing it to all my friends.
My first time here, I came on a Saturday night, during prime time. It was about a 40 minute wait for 2 people. Once seated, we ordered the Original Dry Fried Chicken, Dried Sauteed String Beans, Combination Chow Mein and
Potstickers
with a bowl of rice.
The dry fried chicken was hands down, the best Asian fried chicken I've ever had. The wings were cooked perfectly, bursting with flavor. Each order comes with about 9-10 wings. The sauce goes great on top of white rice too! The string beans were really good too. It complimented the chicken. The chow mein was a it too oily, but still delicious. The
potstickers
were massive. I recommend sharing the plate of 6 with 6 people... My top two favorite things were the wings and green beans, definitely a must try.
The customer service here was okay. They are very busy so sometimes its hard to get the server's attention. The atmosphere of the restaurant itself resembles any other Chinese family restaurant.
The parking situation here is very bad though. Located in a very popular area, its hard to come across street parking. I had to circle around for 20 minutes before finding something.
Overall, I highly recommend giving this place a try. Its a good place to go with a bigger group of people, that way, you can do family style meal.
Pro tip: There is a San Tung 2 right next door, put your name on both and see which one gets called first. From my experience, San Tung 2 has a shorter wait time. But there are a few items, like dumplings, that are not served here."

2. The

3. Absolutely don't miss out on the fried chicken (wet or dry but the sauce they put on it is really magic.)
So this place gets ridiculously crowded for dinner time (I've driven past the crowds on the way home) but at lunch actually it wasn't too bad. There was about a 5 min wait while they cleared out a table for our party of two. The place is fairly spacious with lots of room for big parties but they also have some four tops for those that are traveling lighter.
We ordered the fried chicken,
potstickers
(on the recommendation of a coworker and fellow yelpers), honey walnut shrimp, and the shrimp and leek dumplings. All really tasty. The honey walnut shrimp is probably pretty standard and I've had better dumplings at other places but these were still pretty good. I'd recommend the fried chicken (did I say that enough yet?) and the
potstickers
if you're at a loss.
They have lunch specials and the lunch special fried chicken was 6pcs as opposed to 12. They are served wet or dry and I thought we ordered ours dry but they came with a sauce on it.. which I would think would be the wet ones? Either way they were still super good.

- Sizzling Rice Soup - Peppery soup perfect for a cool night. Will order again!

Potstickers

The

were good. The dumplings were good. The wings were bomb. Would I line up at 9am or 10am to eat here though? Nooope!
The wings are crunchy and the sauce is the perfect concoction of sweet, bbq-like, and sticky but I can't fathom the idea of lining up for these wings... Don't get me wrong though - the food is good but I wasn't blown away.
We arrived about 10 minutes before San Tung opened for dinner and were one of the only few people in line. However, this place quickly got filled 15 minutes into dinner service. Parking was a breeze too so I'd recommend coming early!
Verdict: Skip the early morning line and come for dinner."

potstickers
we got had holes on the bottom, I guess it really stuck to the pot (lol). The other dishes we ordered were fine, nothing special (green beans, chow mein, fried rice, eggplant and dry fry shrimp - heavy on white pepper.)  Service was just OK (for a typical asian restaurant), water wasn't refilled, they forgot a couple of dishes but was prompt when notified and when I asked for some hot water, server gave it to me in a glass, not a mug so it was kind of difficult to pick up.  I would return just for the chicken wings but will ask for light sauce."

Upon arriving we saw a large crowd of people waiting outside so my boyfriend dropped me off in front while he went to look for parking. *your whole party needs to be here in order to be seated* . The whiteboard to write your name is to your right as soon as you enter. Put your name down and wait.
The place is relatively small, so not much space but I did notice a small separate dining room for a larger party. It wasn't that long before we were seated maybe 20 minutes? I'm pretty patient so wait times don't bother me too much.
We ordered:
2 orders of the original
dry
fried chicken - not sure why it's called
dry
because they are the exact opposite. Chicken is moist and covered in
sauce
. The
sauce
is sweet, tangy, and salty. It has some red pepper flakes in it. Reminded me of Panda Express's orange chicken but better. Plus they use drummettes & wings.  This is what they're known for and my boyfriend and I were fans! Soo good.
Szechuan roasted duck & buns: one of my fave Chinese wedding dishes which I had to introduce to my Mexican boyfriend. He fell in love! He cleaned the bones and basically ate whole thing by himself. I personally think I've had better but I'm just glad he liked it.
The
dry
black
bean
noodles
were alright. Definitely nothing out of this world. The texture of the mushy
noodles
kind of grossed me out.
Overall I give this place 3.5 stars rounding to 4. The chicken alone made up for the lack of customer service. The servers were disgruntled and some of the plates and tea cups were dirty. Overall I had a great time and we took home leftovers."

The chicken was saucy but still was crispy which I really appreciated. The chicken was not soggy or anything which I loved. It had a kick of spice and a kick of sweetness to it. SOoOoOoo gOoOod. The wet chicken was not that different from the
dry
chicken but just slightly sour. It was still very good but my friends and I preferred the
dry
chicken.
The other dishes were honestly so delicious and fresh. Had tons of flavor. Very affordable Chinese food. I am constantly thinking about the fried chicken from here despite only having it once in my life. We devoured all of the dishes bc this place was just that good. I can't wait to come back here.

dry
fried chicken, so that's what I came for. Now mind you the wait can be incredibly long for dinner and weekends. If you're lucky enough to come on a weekday during lunch then the wait will be closer to 20-30 minutes as opposed to 30+ minutes.
So, expect no service because Cantonese restaurants are business only where you order food, eat food, pay, and leave. You're not there for a pleasant conversation with the waiters. So the
dry
fried chicken had a great crunch to it and the
sauce
was caked if not caramelized onto the chicken. The
dry
black
bean
sauce
noodles
are good and the meat and veggies aren't cut so finely where they all get lost and congregate at the bottom of the bowl.
All in all, San Tung is good quality food but I wouldn't wait longer than 30 minutes to wait for a table though. So if you want to eat here, come before the lunch or dinner rush or go on a weekday for lunch."

As you walk in looks like a hole in the wall, located believes someone's house.
Spacious dining room, clean (not spanking clean) clean where it's not questionable.  How I test cleanliness is if you can take a peek into the kitchen and also see how clean the up keep of the bathroom is.  That will give you insight.
When we arrived it was late afternoon around 3pm, not many people which was great because the wait here is exceptionally long.  Imagine capacity of this restaurant holds 80 and its usually packed.
We sat down and got service right away.  There was a table nearby where many of the staff were sitting on a round table and the table was filled seriously a mound of fresh green
beans
.  There was about 5 staff members cleaning the green
beans
. It was fun to watch as they works methodically and quickly.  Very efficient!
As we got our drinks and the menu.  Menu is several pages which looked like hundreds of selection.  When I see a menu that's more than 6 pages I get overwhelmed.  What's nice about their menu is it's all very organized under category.
We ordered everything that they are known for, chicken wings and the

eggplant and pan

San tung is actually the first restaurant my girlfriend and I had arriving to San Francisco. I've never been to San Francisco, but everyone has been talking about it. All my friends who have came here mentioned the
dry
fried chicken wings!!
We walked inside and it was already pretty busy by noon. I'm so glad we made it in time before the rush of locals came through. We put our name down and were sat down at a table within ten minutes. Pretty happy we didn't have to wait because I hear it's sometimes a long wait.
Anyways! So we ordered the
dry
fried chicken wings, the
dry
black
ban
noodles
, and the dumplings. The
dry
black
ban
noodles
and the dumplings came out first. I'm glad it did because i'll tell you right now that it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. The
noodles
were plain and the
sauce
didn't have any flavor at all. It was just ok, I don't think I'd have it again to be honest. The dumplings had a lot of flavor to it, you didn't need to add extra soy
sauce
to it. However, there was too much leech in it and not enough shrimp. Saving the last dish for last!
Time for the main dish! The
Dry
fried chicken wings. Hands down, I only give this restaurant five stars because of this dish. Other then that I don't think I'd recommend anything else. The chicken was so good, it's not your normal chicken wings. Very crispy, tender, and the right amount of spices. Golden and the
sauce
on top of it was bomb! Please do yourself a favor and order like a gang of these and have some rice also lol. Crazy how one dish taste so much better then the rest. I heard the green

Of course, we got their special fried chicken, along with some dumplings and
noodles
.  The dumplings were OK, nothing to really write home about.  The presentation was a little dull, so there were no oohs and ahhs when it was dropped off on our table.  The
dry
black
bean
sauce
noodles
were OK too; the portion size seemed smaller than what I had expected and it's supposed to have seafood.  I could barely see-food, only a few pieces.  This was a bit of a bummer.  As for their fried chicken, I didn't see it standing out beyond the likes of places like Bonchon.  Sure, it's good, but I'm short of calling it amazingly special.  The food didn't wow me, and I felt that prices were a few dollars higher on each entree than other Chinese places.  I think the popularity of this place has allowed them to increase the prices, but I personally didn't feel the quality or quantity was worth it.  It's not a bad place, but wasn't great either.  Service was on par with other Chinese restaurants.
I'm glad I finally had a chance to come back after so many years, but not sure if I'll be back.  Did feel overhyped."

There was one time I left because the wait was waaayy too long. There were also a couple times we made the drive out and the were closed when their hours said they would be open! I do recommend calling ahead to see if they're open because it was at random times! But still 5/5 stars because I'll always come back.

The original

is super tasty and sweet, and you can occasionally taste a very small hint of spicy (very small though) because there are a few chopped up red chili peppers. In addition, the wings are super crispy coming out. I don't know about you but it is so much more satisfying biting into a crunchy chicken wing than a soggy one. That, the
sauce
, and the warm tender meat made this dish a must have. Hell, I'd bring my friends here to binge on the wings.
Garlic eggplants: 4/5. Very garlicky taste. I love garlic so this is a solid dish. Warm and moist eggplant was yummy, and like the wings, had a verry small hint of spicy.
Black
bean
sauce
noodles
: 3.25/5. I actually mistakenly ordered the
dry
black
bean
sauce
noodles
, but the waiter was very good and got us some of the
sauce
for the non-
dry
noodles
. It was decent, but nothing spectacular. Not much squid meat in it though, which was slightly disappointing. I wouldn't mind getting it again."

Since a friend and I were going to be at Fisherman's Wharf, I suggested doing a seafood dinner at Pier 39. I made a reservation through Yelp for a party of two about a week prior for Thursday, September 27th at 7pm. We showed up a few mins early and had to wait for a little bit. We were seated about 10 mins after our reservation at a table by the window, so we had a nice view.

I wanted the crab and

chowder
. Since my friend and I always over order, we added the shrimp. The
clam
chowder
was nice and creamy with a good amount of
clams
. A little thicker than I prefer, but still a good bowl. The crab was a little disappointing. There wasn't enough garlic flavor. Plus, the best part of the crab, the head, was missing. It was just an empty shell for decoration. If a restaurant states a whole crab, I think that should include the head. The shrimp were okay. Had a nice heat, but I didn't really like the sauce. A little too sweet for me. Dinner came with complimentary Bread & Butter, which was good for soup dipping.
Service here was nice and friendly. They were busy cuz there was a convention in town, so there were times when we had to flag down our server. The wine was good and paired well with our food. Both cocktails were okay. A little light for my tastes, but at least the pricing wasn't too bad.
A nice dinner for a touristy spot, but the food was a little underwhelming. 3 stars."

award
winning
clam
chowder
.  The calamari is one of the best I've tried, and I'm a huge sea food lover. It's paired with fried onions and jalapeños. The dipping is a creamy aioli sauce that truly brings out the flavor of the calamari. For the entree, I usually order the linguini and
clams
. The amount of
clams
that's served is unbelievable! If you aren't in the mood for something super heavy, I would go with this dish to satisfy any seafood cravings. It also comes with a slice of garlic bread that pairs really well with the sauce. My family is a huge fan of the shellfish platter. Although it's a bit on the pricier end, it encompasses all the seafood favorites that anyone can ever wish for in a meal! Mussels,
clams
, shrimp, and half a Dungeness crab.
Price & Portions:
Clam
chowder
: I usually go with a cup, but for an additional $2 you can get a large bowl to share between 2-3 people!
Calamari: I would say for a $15 plate, it can comfortably serve 3-4 people as a starter dish!
Linguini and
clams
: Not a lot of pasta, but still quite filling. $20
Shellfish platter: ~$50 for a sizable amount of seafood

We were greeted by our waiter who took great care of us throughout dinner. He was personable, attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu.
We started off our seafood feast by sharing the Red Chili Garlic Shrimp appetizer ($16).

For my entree, I went with a lighter plate, being the Seared Pacific Cod ($28). The fish was seared perfectly with a golden brown, slightly crisp top. It was served with white beans, chorizo butter, tomatoes and spinach, then finished with a dab of garlic shallot aioli. The aioli added an extra layer of flavor to an already savory plate and I loved the white beans as an alternative for a starch. With the Cod placed on top of it all, it was truly the highlight of the dish. Two of my family members ordered the Mixed Grill, which was a combo of salmon, cod and shrimp served with vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes. They enjoyed their entrees as well.

But the service here, was just terrible. Our drinks were never refilled or asked if we wanted another drink. We had to ask for everything, straws, etc . Our table was never cleared at anytime either. All of our plates were just sitting on the table. I was stacking plates one on top of another to open up space. Even after we moved on from the apps to the dinner items everything was left behind, app plates, the empty app plates, the oysters, everything. The oyster dish was sitting on our table even when we left which we finished fairly quickly after they were dropped off at our table. The ice turned into water and the oyster shells were floating around in the dish.
After paying $170+ dollars is this what I should expect? By all means I have no issue spending money on food. But it really just hits a nerve when I get crappy service and I'm paying for it.....

* Jumbo Scallop & Crab Risotto ($35) - SEASONAL ITEM. Wow again. These were some of the best scallops I've ever had in my life. They were so buttery and juicy and perfectly seared. The risotto was creamy and the crab made it even more flavorful. The dab of pesto was a nice touch.
* Cioppino ($34) - Ok to be fair, by the time this came out, I had stuffed myself silly with sourdough bread and the above two dishes. This was still amazing though. Very flavorful and wonderfully decorated with an abundant of seafood. No tough pieces, everything F R E S H. Note, they provide you bibs so don't be afraid to get the cioppino the normal way (and opt out of the additional $6 services for the ready-to-eat way).

We ended up ordering the mussels and their

Several minutes later, our meals had came out and we both started digging in. The mussels were perfectly cooked and marinated in the white wine broth. There was a subtle taste coming from the roasted garlic and a sweet tang from the tomatoes. A beautifully well executed dish I must say.
As for the
clam

had chunks of potatoes, bits of chopped

clams

is quite good (particularly with the added crab) 4/5. We usually come for the lobster (5/5 very fresh) and Dungeness crab (5/5 the garlic is seriously good! This is their best dish!); we have had some other dishes here and there that were reliably good but nothing that springs to mind 1-2 years later. Service is usually quite good and you can get seated usually within an hour even if there is a wait - no problem there's lots to do while you wait!
This time around we got the
clam
chowder
again as well as the seared pacific cod and the mussel fries. The mussel fries were fabulous (5/5); being a seafood house you might not expect their fries to be top notch but they are, and the cream sauce was delicious. The Pacific Cod, which was the dish recommended by our waiter, was honestly our least favorite dish that we have tried here. I generally prefer for my cod to have that juicy, oily mouthfeel and the cod was a little dry, maybe due to the thickness of the fish (don't know if you can tell from the picture but it was about 1/4 inch thick when it arrived on the table). However our waiter was fabulous at everything else, including getting our check to us early as we had lost track of time and had an upcoming appointment.
My brother usually comes with us and always gets the burger because he doesn't like seafood. It's alright, but really why come to a seafood house for a burger? It does comes with those delicious fries.
Tl;dr: great views, great service, great area, generally great food. Get the
clam
chowder
, lobster, mussel fries, and 100% get the Dungeness crab. Don't expect too much from the non-seafood options. Expect tourist prices given it's a tourist location; to me it's worth a few extra bucks a dish if we are going to be hanging out at the piers for the day anyway. We will be coming back!"

He was accommodating and made sure our dinner experience was an unforgettable one.
We were all pleasantly surprised by Justin's attentiveness, how fresh the food was and our overall experience considering the restaurant is in a tourist trap.
If you're in the area and don't mind the wait and the crowds, Fog Harbor is worth the visit."

Well, Fog Harbor was my first dinner stop in my 11-day trip down the west coast. Our theme was seafood for our San Francisco stops, since I personally have never been to the Pacific coast and really wanted to test out what's so great about their seafood.
We reserved via OpenTable and had to wait about 15-20 minutes for a window seat, but we did get a seat eventually and were promptly served.
Our dinner included the ""award winning"" clam chowder,
dungeness
crab
cakes
, garlic roasted
crab
, wild salmon, lobster tail, and the lobster mac and cheese. Well, the first thing we realized was we ordered way too much. I understood America and their big portions, but the portions were not just big, they were huge. The garlic roasted
crab
had to have been at least 5 pounds, and I was actually completely shocked my mom managed to finish the whole
crab
(although she didn't even touch the corn cob and potatoes). The lobster tail also tasted very good, and that we were actually able to complete. The award winning clam chowder definitely lived up to its name: Creamy (but not too creamy) soup with plentiful clam chunks and easy on the potatoes. The wild salmon was also good, however once again it was so large on portions we couldn't finish it. The lobster mac and cheese was baked and was probably the disappointment of the meal as it really didn't taste anything special, especially when comparing the other orders.
Service started brilliantly, and quite frankly I don't really blame the waitress that much for the slightly worse service we got as we were finishing our meal, since the restaurant closed at 10 and we were still eating at 10:45 (I did say the portions were huge!!!). We finally left around 11 and were the last customers departing the restaurant, having finally experienced seafood in the west coast...miles better than the east coast."

Upon arrival we waited for about fifteen minutes before being seated (for a group of three) at a corner not far from the
Crab
House.
We ordered two cups of clam chowder, and one in a sourdough bowl. Apparently the basket of bread was sourdough, so the sourdough bowl wasn't necessary. The chowder was great - as the restaurant claims - ""the best in San Francisco. ""
We also ordered  Crispy Bay Scallops,

Its location on Pier 39 might initially be a turn-off if you are really just trying to scratch a seafood itch and don't relish the idea of wading through all the tourists milling around the shops. However, the food is worth it. Luckily enough, the restaurant is located on the second floor of one of the buildings closest to curbside, so not much wading is involved.
I would describe the interior of the restaurant as ""modern"". The seating options are a mix of booths and standard tables, as well as space at the bar, which I think was for walk-ins. Large windows facing the moorings for the Blue & Gold tour boats lets lots of light in during the day and makes for a nice view from the window tables.
The menu is definitely geared towards seafood aficionados, though there are some non-seafood choices. As I understand it, Fog Harbor is part of the Simmons Family Restaurants group, which has several types of seafood restaurants in and around Pier 39. One thing to bear in mind is that this is the more ""proper"" of the group's restaurants, and is pricier as a result.
You will be hard pressed to find better seafood for the price though. On both of our visits here, we ordered the cioppino (seafood stew), the clam chowder, and the bay scallops. The seafood is all fresh, tasty, and generously portioned. The main courses I ordered were the
lobster
tails
on our first visit, and the scallop and crab risotto the second visit. Both dishes were phenomenal.
One thing worth mentioning is that the servers we got both times were very attentive and friendly. Our second visit was actually for a birthday lunch, which I made a note of on my reservation, and our server (Kayla) gave us a dessert on the house, complete with a candle in it! It was the tiramisu, which is definitely worth saving space for.

-The food is very good. We had the Bay Scallops, Mixed Grill, and
Lobster
tails
- all of it was tender, juicy and seasoned well. Portions aren't huge, but they are certainly big enough you won't leave unsatisfied.
-Service is top notch. The server (Raphael) made several good recommendations and was very sociable. He was attentive without being intrusive.
-Ambiance. Has a nice view of bay and the bridge and the decor is upscale without being gaudy. Definitely had a great vibe to it.
Bad:
Feels roughly 10-20% overpriced. Definitely great for special occasions, but the prices mean this will probably not be a weekly event."

Noticed that the girls at the table next to us were served quickly and he spent a good deal.of time chatting with them and encouraging them to rate his service. Not sure if they did, but I sure am! Justin, as a former waitress I left you a bad tip, it takes a lot to get a bad tip from me. Hope you learn quickly before you run off more customers like me, a bit older with money to spend. When I told you my food was cold you said sorry, took the plate away and that was it.

ahi
tuna
. The clam chowder was definitely great, it was not too heavy but just enough, it had a great portion of bacon and all the good stuff. The crab cakes were good as well. I liked the scallop and crab risotto as well. But the service here, was just terrible. Our drinks were never refilled or asked if we wanted another drink. We had to ask for everything, straws, etc . Our table was never cleared at anytime either. All of our plates were just sitting on the table. I was stacking plates one on top of another to open up space. Even after we moved on from the apps to the dinner items everything was left behind, app plates, the empty app plates, the oysters, everything. The oyster dish was sitting on our table even when we left which we finished fairly quickly after they were dropped off at our table. The ice turned into water and the oyster shells were floating around in the dish.
After paying $170+ dollars is this what I should expect? By all means I have no issue spending money on food. But it really just hits a nerve when I get crappy service and I'm paying for it.....
I would go else where if your thinking about The Fog Harbor Fish House."

For starters, we had the calamari, red chili garlic shrimp and mussel fries. All were quite tasty, particularly the garlic shrimp. That sauce had the right amount of spice and kick.
We followed with their award winning clam chowder in a bread bowl--thick and creamy with plenty of clam chunks. Just YUMS!
For the main course, we ordered the cioppino,

For appetizer, I tried the Clam Chowder in the bread bowl which was really creamy and tasty, fresh oysters - freakin' delicious, and even the baked oysters were noteworthy, and the crab cakes were to die for! For entrees, we got the seasonal Jumbo Scallop and Crab Meat Risotto and the
Seafood
Penne
. Both were solid dishes! I loved the crab flavor in the risotto.
Infamous restaurant in Fisherman's Wharf whereas the wait can be for hours. Luckily for us, Yelp Waitlist was the MVP! I wish more restaurants implement this in NYC. I simply opened my handy Yelp app and tapped to join the waitlist (must be within 40 miles) while I was commuting from my hotel in Lower Haight. It would give me an estimated time to check in with the hostess and approximately how many parties are ahead of us. My friends and I were exploring Fisherman's Wharf the entire time until time got closer. Ta Da!"

For the price, location, and food selection we had decent expectations. We started with alcoholic beverages which were decent, but didn't taste like much alcohol was in them. We ordered appetizers of Calamari and Clam Chowder which was quite delicious. No complaints there. However, our entrees came out and that's when our experience took a nosedive. The table ordered the recommended dishes such as the
Seafood
Penne
and the Fish and Chips. The battered fish was bland and tasteless, and the
Seafood
Penne
Pasta left more to be desired. The sauce was so thin it slid right off the pasta leaving a plain noodle. The service was awful, and I'm pretty sure the server was high the entire time. I expected a lot more from a nicer restaurant and wish we had chosen a different place."

Clam Chowder lives up to the hype and I made the rookie mistake of not getting it in the bread bowl. They have great bread that they give you before the meal. Any place that gives me breads always has a special place in my heart. I ordered the
Seafood
Penne
which was bomb and very reasonably priced. The service is excellent and it feels like seconds after you order, the food is at the table.

We agreed on Fog Harbor Fish House based on their Yelp reviews (thank you, fellow Yelpians).
We started with the calamari. Mouth.Watering. it's the jalapenos, i swear! And to top it off with the lemon aioli. I died, inside. Happily.
The shellfish platter is a must! The hubs is a big guy, so the platter for two plus the lobster was filling for him. I feel as though if he were to have bought it for 1, he'd be asking for a snickers bar (drumroll, with a hit of the symbols - bam). Shellfish platter for two came with 1 whole crab, 12 clams, 12 shrimp and 12 mussels. We added a lobster for an additional cost.
The
seafood
penne
was satisfying. Not as much flavor as I wished for, but I guess it's expected when you have a variety of
seafood
in a pasta - I'm assuming they were trying to put an emphasis in the
seafood
, rather than seasoning it up and hiding the seafood's natural flavor. And I am not mad at that.
And to end our beautiful experience (almost cried because desserts are always a reminder that you are almost done) I couldn't help, but salivate over their apple crisp. Lord, help me.
Just screw this review and go and get yourself a seat at this place."

I ordered the

seafood
I found inside my pasta was fantastic.  In fact it was my first time ever trying mussels, and this restaurant has me hooked... Unfortunately I haven't experienced any other restaurant that matches the yumminess of this one though!
There is plenty of seating and did not have to witness any wait.  The waiter was very nice and quick to serve us.
The view and ambiance was also really quite wonderful.
Parking could be a problem for some people, yet if you are familiar with San Francisco you should know public transportation or walking is really the most viable way to get around.
I'm so excited to eat here again"

We arrived for an early dinner. I knocked one star off since our first server was passing out water and reached across the table and said to my mother ""take the glass, honey."" Not only is that condescending but it's a sign of an improperly trained server as you should never hand something to a patron. The shift was changing so luckily that server was replaced with someone more professional. Cocktails, appetizers, entrees and dessert...no complaints!
